1,Drugs,"""Addict"" has become a profit driven word used by corporate rehab to convince perfectly capable ppl into thinking their powerless and need their help. Some do, but these ppl often have clear addictive personalities or compulsion issues from a number of possible factors. Still, not all these ppl are addicts either. I have a very complex dysphoric mania w/ major depression disorder that is medication resistant, but I keep the monkey off my back with one tool... It's going to sound cheesy, but it's self-love. You have got to learn how to love your fucked up self. Thankfully for me it was confrontation, psychedelics, and patience. Therapy can also be helpful, but expensive and hard to find a good one. Lots of people are self-medicating. These condescending rehab types jump on here trying to push their propagandized guilt onto everyone else, to support their own reality. This is because they were torn down and not built up. And I dabble still once or twice a month. You go 4 weeks feeling nothing but dysphoria (dread) and see what you do. I sometimes need that break. But I also got myself off all my ER pain medication, on my own and by my own fruition, when I could have continued it indefinitely. When I started turning down Dilaudid, I knew I'd finally gotten somewhere. In the past I would have taken numerous different drugs to feel some euphoria, but they'd often make matters worse, so the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. And because I actually love myself, I stopped putting myself thru that shit. So no, not everyone on here thinks they're not a druggie and actually are. There's just a bunch of brainwashed types that don't know their own strengths and probably never will.",0,0,-1,-1
2,medicine,"""We"" are the people who need to argue with physicians who base their diagnoses on anecdotes and beliefs. ""What else could it be?"" A wide variety of things. The patient wasn't even admitted. Maybe they went home and was hypotensive. Maybe they had poor PO intake because they were feeling crummy. Maybe they had an ATN secondary to a drug you gave them during their first visit. Maybe they were self medicating with NSAIDs for the pleurisy. Maybe they actually had something like SLE and that would tie together pleurisy and nephritis. This sort of lazy thinking is exactly why so many people believe in CIN. Correlation is not causation. Just because a CT scan was incidentally done a few days prior, doesn't mean an AKI discovered days later has anything to do with it. If they'd had no scan, what would you have blamed it on then? Or would it have been unexplained?",1,1,"Just because a CT scan was incidentally done a few days prior, doesn't mean an AKI discovered days later has anything to do with it.",-1

4,AskDocs,"(I am not a doctor). So, my kid is similar (poops near daily, usually small pebbles). After incidentally finding lots of poop on an x-ray, we learned the tiny pebbles aren't great and our kid is likely critically slightly constipsted (even though they're pooping daily!). Our doctor gave us a chart for how much miralax based on age size of the child and how often. It also has two stages, and we did the ""clean out"" stage first because of the X-ray full of poop. We had an appointment with our pediatrician to discuss the poop after we got an ER x-ray that showed a ton of small poop balls throughout. The ped told us not to give the meds the ER recommended (because it was my kid's normal we discovered that needed correction, not an acute poop issue) and to instead follow this chart (stage one to clean out, then stage 2 to maintain and/or taper). We were that we could do stage 2 (which was essentially miralax, dosed there in the chart, for x days at y times a day, then tapered down) as often as we needed (when saw the pebbles come back or had no poop for 48 hours). If we needed to do stage one (a clean out), we had to call and have a phone appointment to make sure it was warranted, but we were told what to watch for. We also had a long discussion about the behaviors and dietary things that are contributing to the pooping troubles we hadn't recognized, and left with not only the OTC med chart for the clean out and troubleshooting charts, but also a handful of dietary changes to slow roll to my kid to help prevent needing the miralax as much as possible so my kid didn't need to rely on it for long term (unless it does get to that point, it happens, but then we'd reassess). All that to say: if your kid often has the pebbles instead of formed stool, this may be a chronic thing. It may be good to talk to your pediatrician for pointed long term changes and advice specific to your kid, their developmental stage, their diet, and their poop. The miralax alone may not be enough to jumpstart a healthier gut.",1,1,the tiny pebbles aren’t great and our kid is likely critically slightly constipated (even though they’re pooping daily!),-1
5,AskDocs,"(I am not a professional.) Surely the first step should be to consult with whoever is prescribing the citalopram. Important things to be clear on before you do that: 1. Did the episodes begin *after* he was on citalopram? If so, how long after? If not, did the frequency or severity change after he went on citalopram? 2. Do either you or he have the sense that these episodes are dangerous? It's a big difference whether he says nasty things (which you know are an expression of what's happening in his mind at the time, not of his underlying nature) or if he does things like credibly threaten to beat you up. 3. You say he ""self medicates"" with alcohol and cannabis. If he is truly ""self medicating"" then that is saying the current treatment (citalopram) is ineffective or insufficient. Is that the case, or is it recreational? Either way, can he bring himself to lay off for a while and see if that reduces or eliminates these episodes?",1,1,"If he is truly ""self medicating"" then that is saying the current treatment (citalopram) is ineffective or insufficient.",-1
6,medical,"**You need an EKG, stat. Like now.** You NEED to get checked out. A heart attack (we call it a myocardial infarction, or MI), even if it's silent, can be extremely serious. I don't want to scare you, but a silent MI can increase the risk of stroke and death. Please, please go to the ER right now. Tell them (the triage nurses) that you *THINK* you had a silent myocardial infarction and need an EKG. If you only say your symptoms, they could not take you asIt could also be other things, like maybe Atrial Fibrillation (or AFib). It's possible it was a silent MI, but MIs in general are relatively rare in people your age. Still, you need to get checked out ASAP. The longer you wait for MI treatment, the more likelihood of permanent heart damage and maybe the need for cardiac surgery. If you catch an MI early, we have an higher **likelihood** (not an absolute, though!) of reversing it's damage. Also, a BP of 140/88 is considered Stage 2 Hypertension, and is its own diagnosis, so that itself should also be checked out ASAP. Untreated/ignored S2H can and does increase the risk of stroke and heart attack. Also, never take someone else's prescription medications. Ever (unless it's an Epi-Pen and you're in anaphylactic shock). OTC, maybe, but always check the label and consult with a physician, but **NEVER EVER prescription**. All medications, especially BP meds, have varied side effects on different people. Also, many BP drugs actually have very serious and sometimes fatal interactions with other medications. **Propranolol**, a beta-blocker, has been known to sometimes cause new or worsening **heart failure**, which is why we don't prescribe it without a full workup and exam.

10,AskDocs,"1-3 strong beers is more like 2-5 typical drinks, which is well beyond what any doctor would say is okay for someone of your demographic. Hard to say what the long term consequences would be in any one individual, as there is often a lot of heterogeneity in how long people's livers can withstand this abuse. I can tell you I've cared for dozens of 35-45 year olds hospitalized for liver failure related to 15-20 years of being a closet alcoholic. I had one patient die because she was taking Tylenol to treat flu symptoms while still drinking to stave off withdrawal. Unfortunately liver transplant is typically not an option if you are a drinker. That being said, most of these people were drinking more than you. I think you are self treating some anxiety with the alcohol. You drink enough that you can probably feel the anxiety crest as the day progresses. Also that LA commute is killer, and if possible I'd try to live as close to work as I could.

23,medical,"A radiologist reads ultrasounds, and they report everything they see, whether it is signficant or not. Often, they use jargon that is hard to undestand. I'll try to translate: ""The right kidney is normal in size measuring 10.2x4.4x5.4 cm: Normal Parencymal echotexture"": **You have a normal-sized kidney, and the ""meat"" of the kidney is normal** ""A 1.1x0.9x1.0 cm simple cyst"". **They found a small fluid-filled sac about the size of the eraser on a pencil. Its benign, nothing to worry about but since it was seen, they report it.** ""A 6mm echogenic focus with clinical artifact in the right mid kidney likely a nonobstructing stone. No hydronephrosis"". **You have a kidney stone, but it isn't obstructing your urine.** The doc who saw you may not have had access to this report yet, so they probably assumed based on the information had at the time that this was likely muscular-which was probably a reasonable conclusion with what they knew at the time. With this ultrasound info, it is probably reasonable to say that your pain is being caused by this kidney stone. But it is also possible that this stone is unrelated to your pain and that your pain is indeed muscular (although, I'm a bit skeptical that you have right-flank pain that is unrelated to a right-sided kidney stone that is present.) Ibuprofen is a pretty standard treatment for mild to moderate kidney stone pain. At 6mm, passage may or may not happen naturally (something like 40% of stones that size will not pass natrually). People give ibuprofen a bad rap because it is over the counter, but it really is an effective pain medication. Your best bet is to follow up with your doctor (bring this report), especially if you are still having pain.

My copy paste advice for opioid withdrawal in general: * Vitamin C, possibly mega-dosing (I didn't mega-dose myself) * Vitamin D, at the very least no deficit. (I took a lot more: 125 micrograms D3 per day in combo with K2 MK7. Having no deficit is well proven to be very very important; anything above is still in research. But seems logical to take the highest, somewhat safe amount, rather than that absolute minimum, until the worst is over.) * Loperamide: Go easy on that, not much more than the official instructions allow and not more than you need to counter diarrhoea. I think it'll be strong enough to solve that problem entirely. * Keep hydrated while the diarrhoea lasts! * Benzos: If they are not also your vice, they can be your friend here, especially for sleep. I played it very safe by only using like 1 or 2 quarter pills through the 2 main nights, but could have taken more. * If already prone to depression, it helps a lot to start on an anti-depressant ASAP, even while still using (but check if it's safe with opioids. Agomelatin is safe to use with many drugs, and helps with RLS and sleep, but it is one of the less effective ones.) * Stock up on everything you need: Food that is good and easy to prepare, toilet paper etc.",1,1,A well thought through taper schedule might work for you,-1

I tolerated them well for years before this. I'm experimenting with other tools and some of them are just as helpful as medication.

32,Drugs,"Again this opinion is strictly not professional and based on nothing more than personal experience, and intuition which you shouldn't take too seriously, there are also doctors that would answer this honestly without judgment by the way But from what I understand about the classes of drugs and the link they have to heart and stroke/ clotting conditions is that they are only ever a serious issue when it's been abused for a prolonged period of time, it is highly unlikely that you will develop a life-threatening by the blood clottles stroke or heart attack from one or two days in a row of abusing meth, if you get your old buddy back to a static level afterwards before using again then I would be very surprised if anything bad happened.

If you want to do something to protect yourself against your concerns then taking and even over the counter blood thinning medication would make a big difference against developing clots or having a heart attack if that was a reality, although I suppose that an aspirin is a type of blood thinner, although I don't believe it's the most effective And I believe is technically a antiplatelet which comes with the added side effect of helping protect against clotting, maybe talk to a pharmacist and if you're not comfortable discussing your abuse of stimulants even though you should be, you could just avoid and say it every time you exercise you experience symptoms and would this or this medication help The answer to that question would be the exact same answer to your question seeing as there are no interactions with any of the medications to the amphetamines",1,1,it is highly unlikely that you will develop a life-threatening by the blood clottles stroke or heart attack from one or two days in a row of abusing meth ... taking and even over the counter blood thinning medication would make a big difference against developing clots or having a heart attack,-1

34,OpiatesRecovery,"Agreed on that. It's a total lottery. I went to one London borough where they *did* treat codeine addiction, but they did so by putting me on a starter dose of 6mg Buprenorphine - about equivalent of 2400mg of codeine a day, roughly equivalent to being addicted to 200 Nurofen Plus!! At that stage in my addiction I did taper successfully - reducing by half a tablet per day, every week or something. My problem was I was taking it to self medicate for anxiety, and a bad day at work would trigger a relapse. Just to correct some numbers - probably a typo - above. The normal adult dose of paracetamol/acetaminophen is 2 x 500mg =1000mg, and it is OK to take that up to 4 times per day. Lethal doses are as little as 5000mg-10000mg, depending on liver health and body weight, which is why it's a dangerous drug - 10-20 tablets is sometimes (though rarely) lethal. There is a cumulative effect but not usually for people who take a single daily dose, e.g. people who are awoken by back pain but don't need it in the day. My mother took two tablets 1000mg every night for the last 20 years of her life.

38,Anxiety,"Alcohol is not a sustainable solution. No matter how you approach it, it will always end in disaster and make your problems much worse than they had been before. I ""treated"" my anxiety with alcohol 17 years ago and it spiraled out of control. I eventually stopped cold turkey, which was a traumatic experience and very reckless of me to do without medical supervision (it can be fatal). After that I was abstinent for 15 years. Then I started having stronger anxiety and severe insomnia. It began with one sip of vodka (a literal sip) and I slept like a baby. The next three weeks I stayed away from alcohol, feeling horrible that I had relapsed. The insomnia got worse and I drank a little more. Within days, I was back to two bottles of vodka plus wine every day. Three weeks later I was in the ICU and then in an addiction clinic. I was ""lucky"" that I only drank hard for three weeks, but I started exactly where I had stopped fifteen years ago. Moderate drinking doesn't work for people who self-medicate. You'll need more and more alcohol for the same effect. And my anxiety? It was still there when I stopped drinking. The insomnia wasn't, but that was because I had been getting medication for it (Mirtazapine). I have been offered Setralin/Zoloft for the anxiety, but haven't accepted the prescription yet because one of its side effect is insomnia, and I'm terrified of that. Taking both Setralin and Mirtazapine worries me because of the (small) risk of serotonin syndrome. I think the way out of anxiety is exposition/confrontation therapy and mindfulness exercises. A lot of the techniques employed by ACT therapy go in the right direction. The goal isn't to be anxiety-free, but to be able to manage anxiety so that it doesn't diminish your life and who you are. That is what I've been doing and it has helped. Medication is an option and less dangerous than alcohol, so you could look into that. I would suggest to stay away from benzos as the addiction potential there is very high and benzo withdrawal is hell. It's really, really bad and can also be fatal. Only take benzos for actual emergency situations, so just once or twice in a great while.

68,OpiatesRecovery,"Are you being treated for the anxiety which led you to abuse codeine in the first place? My own issues started in a similar way. I had always been an anxious person, as had my father and his father. Then I was prescribed dihydrocodeine after an operation, and I was amazed - I could literally switch off my anxiety. It was like magic. This was before SSRIs were even available and long before they were prescribed in low doses for anxiety. So that set me off on 30 years of self-medication. I came off by tapering down a few times over the years, but a bad day at work, and argument with my wife, or a letter about my income tax would cause a relapse. I am prone to acute reactive anxiety rather than having a true case of chronic anxiety. That said, when it's bad it's bad - on one occasion when I had severe money troubles, I didn't asleep at all for several days. A friend gave me two very strong sleeping pills (acquired from her aunt who had just died of cancer), so I would at least get a couple of nights' sleep. I took them both and was still totally wired. Anyhow after going to my doctor about my addiction a few years ago (rather than going to multiple doctors about spurious back injuries), I have now been on Buprenorphine for a few years (which does help anxiety but without so much of a buzz to chase). I am now coming off using Buvidal. It is a long acting Buprenorphine injection which was designed for maintenance with monthly injections, but they have discovered that when you stop, it acts like its own taper - it takes several months to slowly leave your system. Some people have no withdrawal or PAWS at all, but others aren't so lucky. Sorry for taking so long to get to my point. This is the third time I have tried to stop in this way, and I have got further than the previous attempts for four reasons. Firstly, I have an excellent doctor who convinced me to treat the underlying anxiety. He put me on Sertraline and that made me a bit jittery, so we halved the dose. At that point it seemed to do nothing at all, but within a few months it has really worked. So the idea is that if I get clean of the Buprenorphine (which is a kind of opiate but a very unusual one), my anxiety will be controlled well enough to avoid a relapse. Secondly, having seen me go through periods of withdrawal even during the gentle Buvidal taper, he suggested I have a few Buprenorphine tablets to use on bad days. This was a bad idea. I found an excuse to take them every day. So I asked about non-opioid remedies for the withdrawal symptoms, and I now have Pregabalin for that. I have no compulsion to take it and don't make excuses to take it when I don't need it, but it works for the leg aches and the restlessness I sometimes feel. With a slow Buprenorphine taper, withdrawal symptoms (albeit relatively mild ones for most people) can come and go for a few days here and there for four or five months. That said some people get it much worse, so there is some luck involved. Thirdly, my insomnia is currently at a level where strong herbal (valerian) tablets work well (above the dose recommended on the pack), but we have established that if I get insomnia so badly that sleeping pills are no use, aand that got unbearable, he would prescribe me a one or two Buprenorphine tablets to get me through without my taper being set back. Fourthly, a lot more is known about Buvidal now. When it came out there was literally nothing published by the manufacturers, practitioners and researchers about how to get off. There were just a few stories about people forgetting to come in for their injections and then telling their doctors a few months later that they has no withdrawal symptoms and had stopped using. Since then, it has been established that this works a lot better after at least three doses, which is what I did this time. The previous occasions I tried what is now called the ""one and done"" method. That seems to work for some people, and especially works for a lot of people on a similar injection (unavailable in the UK) called Sublocade, where the half life is more than double so the gentle decline instead of being around 5 months to test clean, might be as much as a year. However, I should say that some lucky people succeed with a ""one and done"" shot with Buvidal, and some unlucky ones get severe withdrawal symptoms with Sublocade. So, while I have failed in the past, I feel like I have learned some lessons and am set up for success this time. I am about ten weeks on from my last shot, and think that at 20 weeks I'll be opioid free, so at that point we will see how well the Sertraline works on the combination of the underlying anxiety and PAWS. Perhaps if it doesn't, then increasing the dose might work, that is if I put up with the jittery feeling for a week or two it might go away. Mine has been a 30 year journey. It sounds like you are using codeine to self-medicate for anxiety which I did for years without getting totally hooked. So I think that if you work with your doctor to find a non-narcotic treatment for your anxiety, you should be fine. It might take a while to find the right dose, but it seems like there is now an orthodox approach for treating anxiety by prescribing an SSRI at a much lower dose (say 20%) than for depression, and some people stay on this for decades, because the side effects at low doses are often non-existent, and certainly not as severe. There are lots of different SSRIs and different ones work for different people. My doctor was sure that my original dose would be fine, but we ended up halving it. Also I think it took about three months for it to work. SSRIs are drugs like like Sertraline (Zoloft), Fluoxetine (Prozac), Citalopram or Escitalopram. I am self employed with a family and literally can't afford to take time off work. That has meant that I can't really do things like tough it out through withdrawal symptoms for a few weeks. I need to remain functional all the time, which is what led me into addiction in the first place. There are many other approaches. For example if I had more time, instead of getting anxiety treatment before withdrawing, I might have taken up meditation or yoga, or even gone to the gym 3 or 4 times a week. Also, I still might relapse. However I'm feeling pretty good, and the last time I tried to detox using the Buvidal injection, I was starting to get anxiety, aching legs and insomnia by about this stage, and this time I haven't. I'm sorry this is a bit of an essay. Really I just wanted to say that the best way to set yourself up for success is to work with your doctor and any other support from friends, family and addiction support groups, and don't be afraid to ask about all the other tools available to control your anxiety. They say it is harder to come off the longer you have been on. So if I'm feeling optimistic about my current plan after 30 years, I think that if you get everything in place to avoid relapse and treat your anxiety, you should be just fine.",1,1,I could literally switch off my anxiety,30 years of self-medication

76,OpiatesRecovery,"As a nurse graduate and a little experience from practicing in public hospitals, when admitted in the ER after a grand mal seizure, I was asking the nurses or the doctor of my case what med and mg they put into the IV drip. They told me exactly. Were you unconscious when they put the Dilaudid ? If they couldn't wake you up they couldn't do different. They have to follow the protocol unless they didn't act following the protocol, and it was mandatory to have your senses aka your consent for giving opiates. Shame on them then, knowing the opis epidemic situation. Here they just put meds and if you don't ask what you were given, you'll never know what they put. It's incredibly how easily they give strong opis in U.S In hospitals. In my country in EU the most you would get for such a trauma is IV Tramadol, NSAIDs, APAP, maybe some Lyrica, then when exiting they might prescribe like 1000s more NSAIDs (all meds are OTC here -except narcotics- nonetheless they like printing prescriptions to get the meds from one out of the up to 100.000 pharmacies we have) and after some months if you were not aware how catastrophic are the NSAIDs to your kidneys (never take NSAIDs more than 14 days in a row) you will come again the hospital with kidneys and liver failure. In my case they only put Diazepam IV along with NaCl ofc. I told em I had a Xanax quiting seizure, 4-6mg per day - dk how long, every day but iirc not more than a year. I asked the nurse, she says ""Diazepam"", I ask, ""how much"" ? She says ""please ask the doctor"". The doctor said 5mg. I said ""whaaat ?"" ""For 6mg Xanax per day I would need at least 100mg"" (~5mg Xanax) to not seize again or get in status epilepticus and then get a prescription to keep tapering, which they never did. The doctor gave me a wtf look without saying anything and just left me there to deal with other patients. I didn't seize after that, *there*. I was discharged in another hospital the next day (was transferred with ambulance, thankfully our healthcare system is everything free) without a single med and thankfully I didn't seize or had any intense WDs after getting home. The remarkable : I didn't seize till I relapsed again on benzos, and seized again after some months due to abrupt taper.

77,medicine,"As someone that is a little bit further in the medicine journey (PGY-11 and counting), this is a very unsustainable mindset and you will end up bitter, cynical, and burnt out (affects your personal, professional life AND it will negatively impact your patient care. As many have said, our role as physician (or any other healthcare provider) is to provide medical advice and care. We cannot control an individual's lifestyle and circumstances. It is unrealistic and unethical to do so. This is not a defeatist view; if anything, this is realistic and for more effective interventions, you need to look at it from a systems-based perspective (read: policies affecting healthcare access, improving socioeconomic factors, etc.). Yes, it is frustrating when the frequent flyer comes back into the ED for the third time that month with status epilepticus because they won't take the damn medication and self-medicate with black tar heroin. It is discouraging when the patient with low income housing and no living wage comes back for DKA because they can't afford their insulin and other meds and cannot follow up with their PCP. All you can do is change your mindset. Remember, not all patients are the resistant to treatment or lifestyle changes. There are also factors way beyond anyone's control that influence this, and it will only hurt and frustrate you to impose these judgments onto patients. If you want to take this on a patient population level, I would suggest going into Public Health and also start advocating for policy changes to improve preventative care/access to health care systems. Vote for policies that also allow people to actually focus on their health by lessening the burdens of their everyday life, from housing, student debt, etc. I do think you would also benefit from volunteering at a free clinic/non profit clinic.

79,AskDocs,"As someone who does have chronic migraines, I can understand your situation. However, I was looking at the comments and you mentioned taking the 1-2 500mg Tylenol per migraine on top of the propranolol. Is your neurologist aware of this? Remember, we ask for every medication (over the counter included). Not sure about your dosage of propranolol for your body weight, but it seems to be nowhere near the max dosage (if anyone with more knowledge can chime it, that'd be great!) and can always be increased. There's also other medications if that doesn't work. Right now though, speaking as someone with chronic migraines, is my concern of you taking the Tylenol. Sure, it might help in the short run - but it's only sone releif, and in the long run, you will suffer rebound headaches which make the migraines seem worse. It's a rather vicious cycle. I'm not asking you to cut it out completely, but see if you can cut down the Tylenol dosage and usage for when the migraines seem to be a bit better. There should also be a variety of triggers for making the chronic migraines. Think of very mild dehydration, certain foods/smells, situations, etc. and try to keep a log of that too! Avoiding what makes the migraines worse, or finding what alleviates it other than medications, really helps. Off the top of my head, for me it's hydration, sugary foods, and 8+ hours of sleep that made my chronic migraines more bearable when I waited for medication. Please do keep me updated.

83,Anxiety,"At the end, it still boils down to sociocultural views. Is it well seen that you pop up a benzo in an stressfull situation? No. It is well seen that you just drink a beer for ""easing it down"" on stressfull situation? Yes. Alcohol, consumed daily, causes probably much worst cognitive decline than benzos (in therapeutical doses), and there must be quite a correlation of people within an anxiety disorder spectrum that turns to the bottle if they're cycled through years of SSRIs that doesnt help. Honestly, at least Valium, I believe it should be OTC with all the warnings and black boxes that you want. I understand the issue with addiction and that many people wouldnt know how to handle it, but there are a few strong points to this argument: 1. Most (if not all) cases of severe withdrawal happens due to a lack of supply for whatever reason (suddenly cut off by an irresponsible doctor, moving countries and getting a refill denied, getting it off streets and the plug not getting any more, etc). This all resolves itself if it was OTC. 2. It is not Xanax. It is the benzo typically used to taper down safely. If you want to taper, you can do it, at your own pace, following a doctor advise or consueling, without the fear of being suddenly cut off. One example of diseases caused by alcohol is Alcohol Related Dementia. Another one is WernickeвЂ“Korsakoff syndrome. These are not mere correlation analysis on public databases with questionable variables isolation (as you perfectly explained), these are very well known forms of dementia or direct brain damage caused by alcohol Which one of those substances is really worst for the brain? Which one is everywhere and encouraged, and which one socially stigmatized and constantly denied?

93,OpiatesRecovery,"But that's the thing. There was a time when people were prescribed a low dose of some sort of opiate for natural pains in life. For me, I first realized how much opiates helped me a few years after being diagnosed with scoliosis and never using the brace recommended. I was about 11-12 years old, and the social pressure of fitting in, just made me not want to take on anything that would make me stick out, but around 14-16 that lower back pain really started to surface. I had the hardest time just sitting through class, and this was around the same time tensions ? in my household. A combination of the two separate sources of pain was instantly solved the first 2.5 mgs of oxy I ever did. I kept thinking, wow. This is a miracle, but I would definitely get addicted to this, so I avoided it. I tried just about every class of drug you could think of as a teen, but never really felt compelled to use any of them consistently. Only alcohol and opiates ever really gave me any sort of real pain relief, but alcoholism decimated my family, and killed all 3 of my mother's brothers. Watching that made me kind of develop a built in, reflex of never drinking more than a few drinks and maybe twice a month or on special occasions at most, but still never alot. This is why it's hard for me to know if my use was for physical benefit or for emotional reprieve, especially since the two tend to potentiaite each other. I guess I just kinda wish the opiate epidemic never took place. The people i used with always looked at me and kinda laughed at the way I used. Always with extreme caution and never more than I had to. I figured, if I can't enhance my life, then what's the point? I looked at it as a tool, not a weapon for self harm. Fentynal, of course changed that to an extent, since it's much harder to determine quality, quantity and potency, bur somehow I made it work for 3 years. It was cheap, effective, but almost too effective, because I really thought, ""why even stop at this point?"" If I could have just walked into a store though, and said ""Yeah I'll take a prescription for 90 5mg oxycodone, no tylenol"" and popped 3 a day, I would have just done that. I worked with what I had at the time, but to me the opiate fame has, and will always be about taming your tolerance. We all probably started with a miniscule amount and got more satisfied from that than whatever amount we progressed toward, and it makes perfect sense when you realize how the brain works and how these receptors switch off over time since all the hardwork is being done for them, but once that happens tolerance occurs and the effectiveness wears off, and that's why I always would force myself to wait as long as possible between uses and use as little as possible. That led me to realize, that what I was essentially doing was self admisntering my own opiate prescription without a doctors direction lol. And that's why I finally said fuck it, and just went on the lowest dose of maintenence possible. It's as close as I'm gonna get to pain management In the US era of an opiate epidemic, and I'm sure no pain management clinic would take me seriously with a bunch of programs and detoxes on my medical record. If only I had saught treatment for the scoliosis pain before self medicating, but again, maybe I'm just bullshiting myself? It's hard to really say at this point, especially after being told I'm an addict like 1,000's of times by people in the rehabilitation industry and NA",1,1,A combination of the two separate sources of pain was instantly solved the first 2.5 mgs of oxy I ever did,what I was essentially doing was self admisntering my own opiate prescription without a doctors direction

95,OpiatesRecovery,"CT off opiates is gotta be one of the most brutal physical and psychological experiences a human can go thru outside of war related trauma. I wouldn't wish it upon even my enemies. So congrats on sticking it thru. It's probably even harder to stay clean there cus it's OTC and readily available. I truly hope you're able to stick with it. Personally only ever abused and was addicted to heroin and fetty, but during my 5-6yrs of daily use, I felt like every time I tried to quit it would be more difficult physically and psychologically. Even if my using dosage was lower. Never made it more than 5 days CT without using some bupe. Most recent time getting off it was absolutely the most brutal for me even tho it was one of my shortest runs (3 months) and lowest dosage (1g a day) at CT. Still think about those withdrawals and how shitty I felt months later. It's a good reminder that it's not worth tampering with again. As well as I think I finally learned my lesson that I'm not special/the exception. I do not have the ability to recreationally use and I cannot ever touch that stuff again. One of the most important things I learned and still remind myself that I learned during treatment for a successful long term recovery is first, you gotta change your identity. Gotta change the people around you. Make sure to remove any and all potential ""bad"" influences. Surround yourself with people that support and understand your struggles and needs. This part is especially difficult for men due to the societal pressures put on us to just man up and handle our own problems. However we have to drop our ego (every relapse story is rooted in ego) and learn to be able to ask for help when we need it and before things spiral outta control. Also gotta also change your places. Stop visiting or hanging around places that are triggers, your DOC is easily accessible and places you used to use at (especially difficult and may not be possible for those at used at home and/or work). Find new places to spend your time at. Finally gotta change the things you do. Former habits or routines associated with the using process must be purged. Replace them with new more positive routines, habits and hobbies. Avoid doing any activities or things that could be a trigger. The more you commit to changing your people, places, and things during early recovery (first 1-2yrs), the higher you increase your chance at long term recovery. Hence why some people go extreme and move to a different city or state and/or change jobs or end close relationships. The second most important factor is revolved around the belief people use to cope with their stress and unhappiness/anxiety. All human beings require 4 things in their life to feel true peace and joy. They are the LAWS. Love Acceptance Worth and Security. All addicts are normally completely lacking in all 4, and use in order to try and blanket or fill that emptiness. However once must be able to obtain them from self, and the easiest way to do that is God. Now I'll explain why. I can't say this for all higher beings/gods, but it's explicitly stated throughout the Bible God is creator and master of the universe. He does not make junk. Everything he makes has a purpose, value, and he loves it. He is the only being in existence of truly unconditional love. Like the story of the prodigal son, it doesn't matter how many times you reject him, make bad decisions, and run away from him. Whenever you choose to return to him, he will come to meet you, love you, bless you, and celebrate you. The Bible is filled with stories of God forgiving, loving, and blessing men who made huge mistakes in life, proving it doesn't matter what mistakes/bad choices you made in life and what ""shortcomings"" you may perceive yourself to have. God who is literally the master and creator of all things still loves you. He accepts you and sees you as more valuable than all the riches of this Earth. Most of all he wants to and will protect you and give you security. Once you truly understand and accept this as a fact, it becomes so much easier to pick up the pieces and begin to accept and love yourself, and see yourself as worthwhile. This is also why I believe step 2 and 3 are at the beginning of the 12 steps and crucial for the rest to have effect. This is also why getting into an intimate relationship in early recovery has such high relapse rates. It's easier to get LAWS from another person so since they seek a partner. The partner might initially provide the LAWS and make you feel better but that makes you reliant on another for your happiness which is basically what we were using the drugs for. Having your peace and happiness contingent on the whims of another human is a one way ticket to a toxic relationship as you become easily preyed by manipulation as well as if that person leaves you or stops providing the laws abruptly it makes you very liable to relapse. This is why it's almost always advised people in early recovery (first 1-2yrs) do not get into intimate relationships. You need already have built up a solid LAWS for yourself first. Now at the end of the day humans are meant to be social for emotional, spiritual, and psychological health. So some of the LAWS can/should come from others. However I'd say for optimal stability 40% or more should come from God, 35% or more should come from self, and 25% or less should come from others. Now I feel like I went on blabbering off topic but imho this is truly important stuff and can really help someone find success in long term recovery so I share. Remember gotta change your people, places, and things. As well as work on acquiring that self LAWS in order to acquire true inner peace and joy. Hoping only for your best! You can do it",1,1,CT off opiates is gotta be one of the most brutal physical and psychological experiences a human can go thru,every time I tried to quit it would be more difficult physically and psychologically

103,pharmacy,"Clonidine is a medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure, ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and certain other conditions. It works by stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brain, which reduces sympathetic outflow and decreases heart rate and blood pressure. Potential for Abuse and Reasons for Misuse Sedative Effects: Clonidine has sedative properties and can cause drowsiness, which might be appealing to some individuals seeking to self-medicate for anxiety or insomnia. Enhancement of Other Drugs: Some people misuse clonidine in combination with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other substances to enhance the sedative effects or to help manage withdrawal symptoms from these drugs.

Recreational Use: While not common, there are reports of clonidine being used recreationally for its calming effects. This is less typical than with other substances but still a concern. Red Flags for Abuse in Prescription Patterns Early Refills: Repeated requests for early refills or obtaining the medication from multiple pharmacies can indicate that the medication is being used at a higher rate than prescribed.

When I get reglan IV, I also get an urge to keep moving my legs, that only goes away if I keep it up. Promethazine can do this as well but it's much less likely so it's a better alternative to zofran, but it's harder to get in the er at some hospitals and some hospitals have special dosing instructions, so nurses hate giving it. I don't know why. Zofran is highly preferred because of these things but doesn't work for everyone and can alter your EKG. All these drugs also slow motility, which comes with its own problems. There's other drugs but they're either older (droperidol) or more expensive (scopolamine) so they're less preferred. Some people can use Benadryl for nausea.

113,ADHD,"Current believed theories based on evidence and facts are indeed trauma. This could be due to early childhood trauma. This could even be prenatal, like if the mother had been exposed to some toxins like alcohol or smoking, but obviously there is a big genetic component to this, because up until the 70s, 80s, and even as late as the 90s in some places, people smoke and drank all the time, even pregnant women, and clearly not every boomer or gen Xer had ADD. This is where the food coloring additives come into place. If you're predisposed, certain food dyes could make symptoms worse if you weren't previously displaying symptoms even though you had it. I believe my mother's father had ADD, based on stories told. Instead of giving you examples of why I think that, I will just say that his grandchildren were warned by their parents that alcoholism runs in the family because he was an alcoholic. I believe alcoholism was a way he self medicated, and his inappropriate behaviors and actions were due to undiagnosed ADD/ADHD and NOT the alcohol. He clearly acted on impulse. Plus, I don't drink. Never been drunk. I will try when offered, but I always don't like it, which is why I could never drink enough to feel the effects. So genetics come into play, but also, there is a thing called ""generational trauma."" Like some ancestor experienced traumatic events, and your biological mental traits may be influenced by this. He was a child of the Great Depression, but all my grandparents were. I don't know your gender, but in the 20th century, girls were rarely diagnosed. This is because we now believe there are three types of ADHD, and girls tended to be more ""inattentive"" instead of ""hyperactive."" If you were a girl who was hyperactive, or both, you were punished a lot, making symptoms worse, and maybe even assess for psychological problems. This is where girls almost always were misdiagnosed with something else, if anything at all. But this where ""X has ADHD, and you don't act like X"" came to be. Back to early childhood trauma and geneticsвЂ¦ вЂ¦I was punished a lot as a kid, and up until age ten, was spanked, but the yelling continued until I moved out. I went to five different elementary schools, and moved 13 times as a child. All of these things could be considered early childhood trauma, HOWEVERвЂ¦ вЂ¦my mother claims that one day the daycare or possibly preschool had to tie me to a chair because I was so wild they couldn't control me. They were completely honest about what they had done. I have no memory of this event. I have a very good memory, but only a few memories from when I was 4, and even fewer as a 3yo. So I'm guessing that I was either 2 or 3 when this happened. So, first off, how wild could a 2 or 3yo be if people who are in charge of toddlers that age couldn't handle me? So, either I was already displaying symptoms of hyperactive/combined ADHD, or symptoms of undiagnosed autism, which girls also couldn't possibly have back then, certainly not high functioning ones. Other stories of me as a toddler involved me just wondering around. I wanted to explore. I would literally go into strangers homes, and actually do have memories of this, but only the ones where they weren't home and my parents apparently did not know about. So I would say I was born with this condition. вЂ¦though I was vaccinated. ??",1,1,alcoholism was a way he self medicated,-1
114,OpiatesRecovery,"DHC has a short half-life of 4 hours, though one of its active metabolites, dihydromorphine, has a duration of action of 4-7 hours. You'll need to dose multiple times a day to keep your blood levels stable to begin with. As your dose gets lower, you might feel the need to split your dose further in order to dose more often, since the relative levels in your blood will fluctuate more. To get started, set a specific time that you will dose everyday. If you're going to dose 3x/day, you can set dosing to something like when you wake up (7am), after lunch (1pm), and last dose at 7pm. If you need, take a couple days to figure out what dose you're stable at (90-100% comfortable), how often you will need to dose during the day, and the approximate time of day that you will dose. Try to stick to a dosing schedule/regimen as much as possible. It will also help to note down each dose you take in an app or whatever. Once that's figured out, start decreasing one of your doses for the day. For example, if you're at 400mg 3x/day for a total of 1200mg/day, you can try decreasing the middle dose from 400-400-400 to 400-300-400 (1100/day). Then, once you're stable, you can go further to 400-300-300 or 300-300-400 (1000/day) and later down to 300-300-300 (900/day) and so on. The order of the dose you'll decrease is up to you. If you feel like you need a boost in the morning, decrease the morning dose last. Or if you can't sleep well, decrease your evening/night dose last. If you go down and notice that your doses are wearing off before the next one, you can try splitting it to 4x/day instead. For example at 800mg/day, instead of 300-200-300, you'd do 200mg 4x/day. Slow tapers work the best and can be used to completely avoid discomfort. Don't try to rush it unless you have a major reason to. It takes more time to fully stabilize on a dose the lower you go. Since DHC has such a short half-life, it might only take a couple days at each dose to fully stabilize. A lot of what you might feel during a taper is often mental/psychosomatic and it's a good to be aware of what's just emotional numbness wearing off vs. actual physical withdrawal symptoms. This is another reason why slow tapers work better. The longer you take to stabilize with each drop, the more time you have to adjust and the less you will suffer. If you're really struggling with a dose drop, don't allow yourself to have a cheat dose/day, but only take a dose that will take you to your previous step of the taper. It takes ~1.7hrs for DHC to peak in your blood when taken orally, so it's easy to take more than needed when you don't feel instant relief. This shouldn't apply with a slow enough taper or until you're close to jumping off, but ik how it is when you want off badly. Tapering would be much easier if you're able to be prescribed helper meds such as Pregabalin/gabapentin, clonidine, etc. Imodium is OTC which will help with stomach issues if that's a symptom you experience during a taper. Kratom can help too, but that's just another opioid that you can get addicted to. If you reach a point where you're in constant minor withdrawal no matter how often you dose during the day, that's usually when you should jump off unless it's because you decreased too much too fast. Don't worry about that though until you're very, very low.",1,1,Slow tapers work the best and can be used to completely avoid discomfort,-1

118,OpiatesRecovery,"Definitely Lyrica. I'm at the same place now but with Neurontin (pregabalin is an analogue of gabapentin and they work in similar ways). It's not regarded as a ""drug"" but after using it for a few years by prescription I am unable to live without it. Totally empty and suicidal feelings. After I take my dose again, after trying to quit, I'm happy as a banana again. Why not take Lyrica instead of oxy? Is it easier to get hold of? Cheaper? Or are you just enjoying it more? I probably should not give medical advice... but that is what I would do, if Lyrica is the reason. Or I would try Cannabis. It is an excellent alternative to Lyrica/Neurontin. It won't stop withdrawal effects, probably, but it will help with your thoughts. Another alternative is to try Neurontin actually. From a doctor. It has much less of an intoxicating effect but may help with what you're struggling with. You won't get into withdrawals after 3 days on oxy. It takes longer than that. What you experience are probably related to Lyrica or your mental health in general. Self medicating with oxy for mental issues is a dangerous path...

Please, do consider talking to a medical professional about sleep meds-- almost all of them, prescription or OTC (like diphenhydramine or melatonin) will gradually become less effective if you take them nightly for a long time, but for example right now I have a month's supply of Ambien to get me ""back on track"" because I was truly sleep deprived. It's OK to look for a stronger up front short term solution to help you regulate and then more long term ""lifestyle changes"" will feel less daunting. Suggestion: Long hot shower before bed. It might not be an immediate fix, but it will probably help you feel a little better calmer. (Also regulates your body temp to be more conducive to sleep.) Suggestion: Get a houseplant. You could even get one of those little pre-packaged grow kits from Five Below or something and grow from seeds. Similar to a pet (with less ""pressure"") I find having something *reliant* on me, not work or school making demands, but something small and helpless that truly needs me, is the small thing that makes me able to keep going. Also, you are a houseplant(affectionate). You need nourishment and water and sunlight and, like an animal, rest. (Note to self: do plants sleep?) Compassion for another living thing teaches you compassionate care for yourself. Also consider, like an animal in the zoo, or a lizard in a terrarium, your environment needs to be enriched. Don't deprive yourself of things that *help you*, no matter how silly they seem. Personally I can't recommend a weighted blanket enough. Don't force yourself to struggle by ""going without;"" it's OK to try and add on little supplements and luxuries to take the edge off while you work on getting better long term. Allow yourself small nice things, even if they don't fix everything. I can't promise you ""it gets better,"" because I'm in my 30s and still in the same boat. But for me, the ironic ""shadow"" of depression is that I'm actually too bleeping stubborn and... stuck? Hopeless? Contrarian?... to actually give up. I want to give up every day, believe me. And I don't think there's some great future out there waiting for me. Maybe there is, but I'm not holding my breath. But *dammit* this mental illness makes me want to die and I am NOT going to give it what it wants. Turn your depression against itself. It feels like it IS you, that that is how your brain works. And it is how your brain works... but sweetie, your brain is broken. So is mine. It's OK to treat your depression like a cranky toddler who needs a nap. You can put your depression in time out. BE KIND TO YOURSELF, WHO IS TRYING SO HARD. But when the depression starts screaming, just tell it no. Name it-- give the nasty voice a name, a real b*tch name and just say ""NO KAREN"" when it wants to yell instead of letting you sleep. You may have to 'rebuke' it every 10 seconds. But you are under no obligation to give it the floor. The depression will be there tomorrow. It can learn to shut up sometimes. Tl;dr -- Soothe, soothe, soothe. Be gentle and soft with yourself. It's OK to stop *fighting* and just pause and breathe. You're not going to lose ground by giving yourself grace. PS-- Hate to say it, but the boxing isn't a bad idea. Less about ""exercise will make you tired"" and more having a way to channel your angry yucky feelings. Journaling is good too, but sometimes you need physical release. Personally I like the driving range. Anything that takes explosive movements, not just steady like walking (although that's good, too).

But that wont help long term at all. It will be a coping mechanism and you will never learn to do it without them. Then there are psychedelics like shrooms or LSD. They might change you. Unfortuantely in a positive OR negative way. Go into them with the expectation that they will change you and they might eat u alive, if u are not prepared. Psychs CAN show you suppressed thoughts, feelings, emotions, traumas, fears, anxietys and all the stuff that you dont want to think about. And if these things come to the surface, while u are tripping and you DONT WANT to face them, deal and dive deep into them, then they MIGHT create an absolute nightmare of a trip. However if u WANT to deal with them, and are ready to look and experience a variety of possible negative suppressed thoughts and emotions, then they COULD give u a completely different perspective and you could learn a lot alot alot about yourself.

Dont do random high doses, instead be patient and do it slow but regularly. This can also improve ur quality of life. But definitely read about Ket therapy and use different sources in the Internet. MDMA can be used as self therapy. Low dose is important. But just read a lot about it and about the risks of the substance. I  do selfmedication with MDMA you should know alot about ur mental state already. Cause you need to know on what exactly you need to work on and have a certain understanding for urself and ur behavior. But im no expert in any way. Pls if u decide to do anything then read A LOT about it and take it slow. There is no substance that will magically improve and change you. There are however substances that you can use to work with, so that you yourself have an easier time to improve and change. That said youre best bet would be a therapist imo lol Substances to cope with mental prpblems will destroy you. Unless you use them as some form of a guide to work on urself.

Like all the problems that you have were built up over YEARS. Some even over one or two decades!!!! So you will need years to improve or even fix ur problems.

161,Drugs,"Except now no doctors in the west (not just the USA) ever want to prescribe opiates unless you've got an estimated span of life that's very short, leaving millions of people in agonizing pain with nowhere to turn but to the streets to gain even the slightlest QoL (quality of life.) - where even in other countries, we're forced to take random mixtures of Zenes and prodrug benzos (they are usually water soluble, or atleast react in acidic conditions similar to the H we get in Europe and the UK where I live.) alongside the tiny amounts of heroin they add for colour and such so it still pops for heroin on piss tests and the likes. You may say nobodies forced, but agonizing pain will make you seek out anything that works, doctors not prescribing opiates leads us down the street route and then they further demonize us as junkies because they can't seem to fathom it all could've been avoided if they prescribed for pain correctly.. In around 2017 when the US Fent epidemic was often in the news, doctors in Europe and the UK (probably Australia too) were given new guidelines that made prescribing opiates inhumanely strict alongside training new and old doctors alike that opiates are basically the devil.. many doctors as a result even associated physical dependency on a prescribed opiate with ""addiction"" and will even cut people off for being physically dependent after years on a prescription as if that equals abuse (or atleast that's what that did to ME and many I used to see at the support group I attended back in 2017. I myself had to turn to the streets and many at the group I attended were so depressed and at such a low QoL they were considering literally killing themselves if they were left to suffer, which they presumably were.. one lad I knew only got his meds back a few months ago when the symptoms of his condition and the constant pain and inability to eat/drink finally led to kidney failure, which could've been avoided by prescribing him the correct pain regimen he was already on for years until 2017 and the hysterical guideline change caused by another countries NEWS... Now he's ""dying"" (they seemingly have no plans to get him a transplant due to his poor health and repeat infections) from kidney failure at age 30 after being bedbound since 2017 and the initial response was a measily 10mg of oxynorm a DAY.. I'm unsure if his dose has increased since, but as we speak often, I'm guessing it hasn't.. as he's still in and out of hospital tens of times a month, as I was myself until I turned to the streets and self medicating myself. This is the new ""epidemic"" when it comes to opiates across the entire west, a complete 360 of over prescription, instead under prescription to the point it causes people to have zero quality of life and further causes them bodily harm from suffering with symptoms that could easily be avoided if treated correctly - but as treating correctly often means prescribing opiates, these people (including myself) are left to rapidly decline and have hugely shortened lifespans ontop of the life they have being that of someone near death already for many years anyway (as many people cannot function or leave their homes/beds etc due to the pain, but still can't get prescriptions.) It's very much the same with benzos in the UK atleast, they won't prescribe them unless it's an emergency dose no matter how severe your MH condition is.. and that's if your LUCKY enough to get prescribed a low dose of a weak benzo on an emg basis (emg being once every X amount of months that you have to request and sometimes wait days to receive the prescription for.) they'd much rather prescribe beta blockers for stage fright for people having chronic anxiety/panic attacks that don't work and tell them to ring ""cahms"" and be told to make a cup of fucking tea to ""calm down"" instead when the medications inevitably don't work",1,1,"You may say nobodies forced, but agonizing pain will make you seek out anything that works,",-1

183,Anxiety,"For the meds to work it takes time. I suggest that you talk to your therapist and maybe ask for a referral to a psychiatrist who will prescribe you paroxetine or something similar. I got my PhD degree while being at my lowest at that time, so it's not impossible. You need meds because obviously you cannot function on a daily basis, and therapy takes months or years. Try herbal medicine like lemon balm tea, valerian root etc. until someone gives you something that will work for you. And most of all: anxiety will not kill you. It will make you feel shit but not kill you. Ask yourself: what is the worst thing that can happen when I have anxiety in class? Faint? Vomit? Hyperventilate? Diarrhoea? Sweats? Shaking? Work on an emergency plan if you want to. If I have this symptom, I will do this. If another symptom, do this. Worst case scenario? You tell the teacher that you need to walk out because you have a panic attack, or just walk out. Nowadays almost everyone has anxiety. When I was a student they looked at me like I was a mental case (20 years ago), but the lecturers understood and cut me some slack. Do you know how many other students go through the same thing as you are going through, but they don't talk about it? Maybe in the same classroom there is a person clenching their teeth trying not to run out of the room, feeling like they are about to die. You are not alone in this crazy world with too many stimuli that fuck up our nervous systems. Try herbs, ask a pharmacist for otc calming gummies or pills, drink some lemon balm, valerian root or hops tea and consult your therapist to get the meds asap. Once you've worked on your problems, you can taper the meds. Also, try meditation, yoga, mindfulness, long walks. They help rebalance your nervous system. Read how to stimulate your vagus nerve.

186,depression,"From my experience, weed and antidepressants have similarities and differences. In my personal experience, I would say that weed provides more instant gratification, while anti depressants provide more long term gratification and benefits. I'm a person with anxiety and depression. Weed often calms me down and provides a lot of relief from anxiety. It shuts down my thoughts so I can lay on the couch and watch TV without thinking about random things that make me anxious. Weed shuts me down quickly and makes my thoughts disappear for a couple hours. However, like you mentioned, the day after I get high, I usually feel a bit hungover or more anxious than usual. Antidepressants don't instantly make you feel calm. You need to take them regularly and consistently for weeks to feel results. It's progressive, rather than instant. I've been taking Zoloft for a year, and it's helped a lot. I still feel all of my emotions, but progressively, my depression and anxiety has improved a lot over the past year. I have higher self worth and I make better choices for myself. I think that there are definitely connections between substances and medications. I'm not a scientist, but I'm sure some of the things that various forms of drugs do to the brain is similar. I would definitely recommend antidepressants and occasional weed or alcohol use over self medicating everyday with weed or alcohol.

188,medicine,"From personal experience: When I was on my parents' insurance (BCBS) I had my annual physicals with the standard blood work, as one does, and there were no problems. But since I'm an MD/PhD student, my program covers health insurance (student plan is United), and I'm healthy, I decided to switch to that plan to save my parents some money. When I had my last physical late last year, United paid for the office visit but refused to pay for the blood work stating that it wasn't preventative care since there was no diagnostic code (I called United to confirm since it sounded dumb to me that an annual physical wouldn't be considered preventative care). I called my PCP and the hospital system's billing department, and obviously they said ""why would there be a diagnostic code with no diagnosis?"". I put in an appeal with the hospital, and after a couple weeks they gave me a call to say ""we did it right the first time"". Then I called United again, and they doubled down saying that it doesn't count as preventative care unless there was a diagnostic code. I don't know if this is normal but I definitely haven't had this problem in the past. I would've tried to appeal it with United, but before then the hospital system sent me another notice of the bill threatening to punt me to collections. So I paid it since I kinda like having a decent credit score :/ At this point I'm almost considering not doing it next year because I don't want to deal with this again. And given my experience, I have no idea what I could do to get United to pay for it. Another story with United. After that fiasco, I ended up going to an allergist since I thought I had allergic rhinitis (I hadn't been tested before but have always had constant swelling of my inferior turbinates that barely responded to over the counter flonase and azelastine and my PCP recommended that I get tested). After allergy testing, I was diagnosed with a vasomotor rhinitis (go figure). The allergist suggested that we start with dymista just to see if the alternate formulation happened to be more effective. Of course, my United plan apparently categorically denies all Dymista prescriptions to suggest that I use the over the counter version instead, as if I hadn't started with that. To be fair, I kinda understand this one, but it's frustrating nonetheless. Oh and I ended up paying for the medication out of pocket and it didn't work either, which is fun.",1,0,-1,dymista prescriptions... alternate formulation happened to be more effective

190,Anxiety,"Go for it. Honestly, nervosity and anxiety can't be avoided when you set out to make changes. There will probably never be a moment (when you're sober) where you'll feel confident about first seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist. You'll probably never feel completely ready. That is something you need to push through. It is the way out of the anxiety, the way to get help. I know that just saying ""stop drinking"" may not make a difference. I mean, I had a relapse after fifteen years of not drinking (first time I had stopped cold turkey, before I knew that this can be fatal) and even though I knew what would happen, I still did it. If you only recently started drinking, with no prior history, you can still gain control of this. Call someone and make an appointment. The alternative is really dire if you keep drinking. Don't fall for the mind's suggestions that you can control the drinking. Some recreational drinkers can, but someone who drinks to self-medicate almost certainly can't. You'll need more and stronger alcohol to get the same effect, and the effect will last less and less. At my peak, I drank two bottles of vodka a day without getting much relief at all. It made the anxiety worse. I'm not proud of these experiences, but if they can help others, I'm happy to share. Alcohol is a really dirty drug. When I was in the addiction clinic I saw some people who had been drinking more and longer than me, and many of them had not been there for the first time. Some of the people I saw, and their state of mind, deeply scared me. Seeing first hand what alcohol does to the brain and the body of people, that shocked me into permanent abstinence. I was ""lucky"" insofar that I had not been drinking for many years and that I had ""only"" used alcohol for self-medication, so once I gained access to anxiety and sleeping medication (insomnia led to the relapse after fifteen years), the reason why I had been drinking went away. But I'll always have to be watchful, because that feeling of everything being managable, of being really relaxed and carefee is always tempting.

My husband was constantly telling me to turn over. I found a free app - sorry, can't remember which one, but there are many - that records your snoring. OMG! I can't believe my husband got any sleep at all. And how could *I* even sleep through that? It was awful! Did a sleep study and found I stopped breathing as many as seven times per hour, woke 20 times, AND experienced PLMS (periodic limb movement in sleep) SIX HUNDRED FIFTY-ONE TIMES over the course of about six hours. I started using a CPAP about three years ago. It's fine, no problems, it's very quiet, and just a tiny bit less than perfectly comfortable. My husband LOVES it. LOL I don't know if my limbs still twitch, or if it's lessened. I've been taking antidepressants for almost 40 years and apparently they can exacerbate the condition. Interestingly, methylphenidate (which I've been taking for about four months) can improve PLMS. Guess I'd need another sleep study to know. But aside from not getting *enough* sleep (revenge bedtime procrastination, anyone?), I do feel so much better with the CPAP. I mean, how could I not, right? I'm hoping to trial getting rid of the antidepressant here soon. I'm really interested to see if my depression is a thing on its own or if it's a result of ADHD being undiagnosed (for 60 years).

213,ADHD,"Hello, I thought I would share my experience as someone who has been working on this for a while. Got my diagnosis last year, figured out I had it about 4 years ago. Still not medicated, due to ADHD medication shortages in UK. It sounds like you're talking about the executive dysfunction we all love to hate. I struggle with it on the daily as I'm sure many others do; with things I want to do, enjoy doing, don't want to do, and NEED to do to keep my life in order. Not wanting to be presumptive but it sounds like you need some ADHD tools, to use with your medication to feel better about how you spend your time. As I'm still not medicated I've had to rearrange my life around my ADHD and it has helped. I have managed to get into a few hobbies and stick with them, and be much more productive, but only through A LOT of mindfulness training to tackle my negative thoughts and the executive function issues. But also, you have ADHD. It's gonna try and get in the way sometimes; you can forgive yourself for not being like ""other people"". That doesn't mean you can't live a more full life and access things that interest you. I have spent a lot of time learning about ADHD, and trying to learn about myself Another thing that's helped me is pursuit of what I actually enjoy doing and things that encourage my curiosity, and changing my life routine to suit me. A big thing that helps me is I've developed a *tick list* or like a menu of things to do. It helps me not veg in a chair for hours by accident or play video games all day. On the menu there is, the chores that need to be done, the exercise options I have, and the work that needs to be done and then options for me to do to chill out. I don't have to do everything on the list, it's more of an aid to memory for me to go ""Oh yeah, I've been wanting to read that book, do some drawing, go to the pottery studio, make plans with that friend, or maybe I should do a yoga class on YouTube because I feel like I have a small colony of bees living in my forehead and I can feel colours"" This helps me, because when I do have motivation, I find it easy to get overwhelmed by choice because ADHD brain is running too fast and wants to do all of the ideas *right now* My brain used to get overwhelmed, cry, and go back to factory settings, and then play 6 hours of repetitive PlayStation or something because it was an escape from feeling funky. Then I'd feel guilty for wasting my life. Instead I have a reminder of things I can build my day around. So I have some structure, but it's not rigid, but there's a rhythm to it. More of a flexi routine. And the more you work at a flexi routine the more things will stick Some things won't stick or work for you, if they don't, bin them off it's your life I'm combined type and a very socially active life seems to suit me, with exercise built in, and some creativity built in too. But also, the inattentive part of me wants to chill out, space away, and have stability and they're very difficult to reconcile. I'm also in the last couple months of studying law part time and working full time so my life is all over the place rn and executive function has a massive strop whenever I need to study ._. Maybe you can carve out some time to think about what you think is a good life, and the kind of you that you want to spend time being? And what things you can do to be more like that person right now? Another thing; just a general discipline thing; if you're struggling to kick a bad habit, you have to remove temptation from yourself to do that habit. If an alcoholic has alcohol in their house, they will get drunk. Speaking as someone who does not buy alcohol to keep in their house anymore because I used to self medicate all the time. If you feel stuck on social media for hours and hours a day, maybe it's time to delete the apps off your phone, just for a while. Not in a cut yourself off from your people kind of way. But in a, ""I need a change, and I'm taking that step"" kind of way. I deleted instagram for 6 months and instagram reels have lost their power over me. Now I just use it to talk to a few friends and post pictures of my cat and random things. Focus apps are also good - like Flora; it's free and you can set it so if you break your focus you pay the developers 50 pence or whatever to give yourself consequences and urgency instead of it just being an annoying thing that locks you out of Reddit for a couple hours. You can also set permitted apps - e.g my flora only lets me use Spotify and that's it. Finally a shoutout to the ADHD Adults Podcast because they taught me more about my condition, and the tendencies associated with ADHD people, than the actual fucking doctors did. I hate podcasts but I love theirs because it's a self described ""chaotic squirrel rave"" run by ADHD people, for ADHD people and is really good for learning about the behaviours that are common in people with brains like yours, so you can figure out more about how you work yourself. That's on Spotify too and probably other places. You have my sympathy that you're struggling. But hey at least you're aware that something isn't working for you anymore.

217,Anxiety,"Here to post yet another pepto success storyвЂ¦ I have been diagnosed with all sorts of gastrointestinal issues, H Pylori, GERD, IBS, SIBO, leaky gut, all of which has culminated in vasovagal syncope brought on by GI events. I am able to function for the most part if I stay diligent with diet, sleep and stress, but God forbid I have a couple of drinks. The next day I am in GI hell that brings on panic attacks which lasted for hours often only ending when I went to the ER and was given Donnatal. I always assumed it worked so well because phenobarbital is one of the ingredients. Well, last night I went out and had 4 beers, nothing crazy, but this morning I woke up at 9am feeling like my guts were on fire. I had ever symptom at its worst, I was shaking, nauseous, had horrific heartburn, dry mouth, cramping, pounding headache, literally everything. I drank water and went back and forth to the bathroom feeling like I was suffocating and going to pass out every trip. This dragged in for 2 hours until I was convinced I was going to die alone in my house doubled over on a toilet and decided I would try to go to the ER once again or die passing out at the wheel driving myself there . I put on a panic attack talk down meditation and shakily brushed my teeth and washed my face, noting that the cold water felt amazing. I thought to myself ""duh, splashing cold water is the first thing people do in every movie""вЂ¦ Crippling anxiety doesn't let your brain divert much energy to rational cognitive functions but I somehow had the brilliant idea to take a pepto tablet just in case it kept me from dying behind the wheel. I read the directions for the upteenth time because I'm a recovering addict who now thinks I'm going to overdose on OTC meds if I take one too many (not really) probably PTSD from losing basically everyone I grew up with in the NYC punk scene. The label said to swallow one with water every 1/2 hour or 2 every hour until symptoms subside. So at 10:55 am I swallowed a single pepto tablet which I had no fear of overdosing on; thanks anxiety for reducing a chick who once had the nerve to move to Tijuana because the dope was cheaper than in Cali to a paranoid lunatic. I decided to give it half an hour. I restarted the panic meditation and laid on the sofa with my feet raised up to avoid fainting with cold washcloths on my forehead and the back of my neck. The noises coming from my guts were worthy of an Alien movie right before some creature burst free of its human host to murder everyone; my cats looked seriously concerned about me. I turned up the volume on my phone and told myself to breathe while checking SpO2 and heart rate on my Apple Watch every few minutes. For 16 minutes exactly until all of a sudden it started to subside! It was as if someone simply turned down an internal volume in my belly and brain. Even the deafening tinnitus I'd had all morning eased up making my pounding headache soften, so much so that I actually fell asleep. It's now 12:42 pm and I feel what I imagine normal people feel with slight hangovers, hungry, tired, and NOT about to die. I wonder if taking it preemptively after drinking would prevent this entirely? Also, in furtherance of the person who equated their symptoms to opiate withdrawal, I had the opposite experience today, I honestly haven't experienced the level of relief I got from pepto this morning since I used over two decades ago. Thanks, Pepto!",1,1,I honestly haven't experienced the level of relief I got from pepto this morning since I used over two decades ago.,-1
218,Anxiety,"Here's the long version of my post. And no, I've never tried antidepressants except for Zoloft, which I only tried for a week because it made me so nauseous. I just stopped taking it. Alright, beautiful people of RedditвЂ”here's my story. My first run-in with benzos that really messed me up was one night when I took a Xanax, drank a few beers, then did a lot of cocaine and downed 15 more beers. I couldn't sleep and ended up puking all nightвЂ”the kind of puking where you're on the bathroom floor thinking you're going to die. Hardcore. The next morning, I felt so sick that a friend gave me another Xanax, and it gave me a bit of relief. But the day after thatвЂ”boomвЂ”I had my first real panic attack. Tunnel vision, thought I was going to faint or have a heart attack. Then I proceeded to have 12 more panic attacks during my ER visit that day. Ever since then, I've dealt with anxiety and panic attacks consistently. For about five years after that, I would only take a benzo maybe once in a whileвЂ”maybe 5 to 10 pills total of 2.5mg ValiumвЂ”strictly for emergencies. Eventually, I swore them off. Then I moved to NYC. A doctor prescribed me .5mg of Klonopin daily for two months. It was blissвЂ”I felt normal, amazing even. But after those two months, I felt like I needed to increase the dose, so I decided to stop. Withdrawal was hell for about three weeks, but then I was okay. After that, I started experiencing hypnic jerks while trying to sleep. So once every week or two (or sometimes three), I'd take 2.5mg of Valium to sleep and stop the jerks. This went on for several months, especially when I was hungover (which was often). I tried TMS for itвЂ”it kind of helped, but wasn't a cure. Things were manageable until I went to Thailand and was accidentally drugged with Thai MDMA (no idea what was actually in it). I freaked out when it kicked in but managed to get back to my hotel, where I melted into the bed for four hours. I woke up kind of okay, but two days later I needed Valium at night again for the jerksвЂ”not every day, but enough. A month later, I drank a MagicMind mushroom drink to help with focus on my first day at a new job. It kicked in andвЂ”boomвЂ”panic attack. I popped a .5mg Klonopin I'd saved in my wallet. Instant relief. The next day I felt panicky again, so I took a 2.5mg Valium. That helpedвЂ¦ but then I needed it daily. And so I took it every day for two months. Eventually, I told myself, ""This has to stop."" So I quit. Cold turkey. BOOM. I have never felt worse in my life. Two straight weeks of absolute hell. I reinstated at 1mg of Valium for two more weeksвЂ”not great, but not horrible. Then I cold-turkeyed again. The past nine months? Absolute hell. My girlfriend broke up with me because I was so sick. I quit drinkingвЂ”been mostly sober for 9 months (except for one big mistake in November). Since August, I've felt like the walking dead: vertigo, hypnic jerks, hallucinations while falling asleep, panic attacks, tremors, pins and needles, chattering teeth, brutal anxiety, and waves. God, the waves. I'm in month 9 now. Until recently, I could say I felt a little better than at the beginning, but this week hit me with a massive wave. Every time I put something into my bodyвЂ”alcohol (which I haven't touched since November), caffeine, Cialis, supplements (like magnesium, agmatine sulfate, or L-methylfolate), if I get sick, eat bad food, sleep poorly, take ADHD medsвЂ”boom. It triggers a wave or a panic attack that feels like Day One. This sensitivity was there before benzos, but now it's amplified. My anxiety has become hypochondriac-level. Constant fight-or-flight over the smallest things. I've done over 100 sessions of TMS in these past 9 monthsвЂ”it helps, but doesn't stick. I've also been doing Havening and hypnotherapy, and it kinda worksвЂ¦ but not enough. I took a genetic mutation test that said Klonopin was okay for me, but Valium wasn't. It also said that the antidepressants that might work best for me are Wellbutrin or Pristiq. I'm scared to take themвЂ”but I'm getting close to trying Wellbutrin. I know I'm closer to the light after 9 months, but I can't keep living like this. I think the benzos have made me insanely sensitive to everything and wrecked my brain. I'm asking for advice. What should I do? Options: вЂў Take Wellbutrin or Pristiq вЂў Power through, stay sober, and heal (but it's been brutal, and I feel like my brain needs outside help) вЂў Try NAD+ IV (did this years agoвЂ”made me anxious for a month) вЂў Try clinical ketamine, esketamine, or Spravato вЂў Go back on Klonopin and stay on it for lifeвЂ”feel good for the next 20 years My brain is so sensitive. Some days are okay, others I'm just lying on the couch with the spins, feeling like I'm about to fall off a cliff or lose my mind. I don't have OCD, but I do obsess, especially about my condition. My ADHD makes it worse. Do I think benzos are the sole cause of all this? Maybe. I've had a great life overall. I'm social, fun (I think lol), but I've been through a lot. вЂў I was born two months premature (somehow I'm 6'2"" and pretty healthyвЂ”besides my brain). вЂў My parents divorced when I was 8. вЂў At 12, after 9/11, I was paranoid for a year, convinced a murderer or terrorist was going to break into our house. вЂў My mom died of cancer when I was 15вЂ”she was my best friend. вЂў I had severe dyslexia, which made me feel ""less than."" вЂў My dad was strict, emotionless, and too smart for his own good. вЂў I used a lot of drugs when I was youngerвЂ”especially weed. вЂў I only used cocaine for about 2.5 years before my first panic attacks at age 27, but I've tried it all: ecstasy, Percs, LSD, sleeping pills, whippetsвЂ”at least once or twice. вЂў I used to hang out with the bad kids and was kind of one myself. Most of my friends still drink and party, but I haven't touched hard drugs in 8 years. StillвЂ¦ my brain feels broken. PleaseвЂ”any advice, programs, retreats, treatments, or stories would help. I will do anything to get back to who I was. Any cost, any commitment. This was hard to write, but I don't care. I want to be the amazing person I know I can be.

224,pharmacy,"Hey quick question. Im a pharmacist too, but less experience in psych. So completely understand your reasoning, and I know it's not black and white obviously. But would you change your choice of SSRI alongside a mood stabilizer for someone with bipolar? My sister has bipolar, is on lacosamide(?) and aripirazole for mood stabilization, and was on paroxetine as well. Obviously with the mood swings drug monitoring and management are imperative; but we're pretty sure (moms and RN and I'm a pharmD) that she developed Tardive Dyskinesia. She's pretty severe in her mood swings; and we're pretty sure she began rapid cycling at some point. She has abused cocaine and other illicit drugs in the past and absolutely may have played a role here. Not asking for advice on her case specifically, but in someone with that type of history of non adherence and self medicating, is there an ""industry or field"" norm for better groups of medications? Because on one hand I think faster metab, but she developed TD, and they often have more ADRs associated with them. But then with the mood cycling it might make more sense for something slower and less activating. Her psychologist won't see her currently because she's avoiding a program, so kinda just trying to get a gauge on what's the best idea for someone like her",1,0,-1,would you change your choice of SSRI alongside a mood stabilizer for someone with bipolar?

226,OpiatesRecovery,"Hey there! Congratulations on making it 5 months. Some people can't put 2 days together so 5 months is something to be proud of. Now, you say that your issues started long before you started using. Were you self-medicating due to mental health things? Sometimes medications don't work for people. If you've tried a lot of meds and are having a hard time finding ones that work for you, there's actually a genetic test that they can run which will tell you what medications will work for you based on your unique DNAGenesight - Psychotropic Testing The other thing that you said that stood out to me is that no one will hold your hand through this. That is true, to a point. No one is going to hold your hand, but there are people who will stand beside you through the worst parts. Men and women who's job/ profession is to help you through a time like this - substance abuse counselors, or regular counselors for that matter. People who are compassionate, empathetic, and most importantly non-judgemental and will help you gain the tools you need to get through bumps in the road like this, or just be willing to listen if you've had a crappy day or week. The other resource that's out there that can be helpful are free self-help groups. They have local ones or online groups. But a lot of local groups will constantly have sober parties or cookouts or little get together s where you can go and meet sober people. There are so many different ones that I couldn't even list them all but some of the big ones are Alcoholics Anonymous - Find A Meeting Recovery Dharma There's also an app called Meetup and sometimes they'll have little gatherings for trivia night or star gazing or a hiking club. It's worth checking out Your brain and body is still healing. So be patient with yourself and just take it one day at a time. Make sure that you're eating right (processed foods and junk food can make us feel crappy too). Your body and brain needs those nutrients to heal itself and just to function properly. Drinking enough water is also essential. Our body is mostly water and if you're dehydrated everything is affected. Lastly, exercise can be so beneficial. Believe me I know it's easier said than done, but even just getting outside in the sun can bring out those feel good neurotransmitters in your brain and make you feel a lot better. Good luck! Sorry for the long post but I get it, I've been there. It took me 7-8 months before I started feeling human again (but I also used for almost 20 years).

227,medical,"Hey there! Went to hospital, unfortunately I will probably need to get a second opinion. I didn't take any pepto bismol however I did completely forget about the anti diarrheal medication I took sunday (1 dose every 4hrs) and completely stopped after it made me projectile vomit everywhere. I brought this with me however this is an over the counter medication from mexico my mom gave me and was all in spanish (no effort was made by staff to review the ingredients although I wasn't sure if this would have helped at the time). The ingredients are Kaolin, pectin, and Neomycin Sulfate. The doctor said these were the same ingredients as pepto bismol and that the Neomycin worsened the diarrhea while the pectin caused my poop to turn black. They prescribed me dicyclomine and sent me home. :/ what he said seemed right in the exam room but by the time i made it to my car it wasnt sitting right with me. I came home to see if what he said was true and any way I phrase it when looking it up the information he gave me comes back as wrong. I feel frustrated and confused.

229,pharmacy,"Hey! Different person responding than you were talking to before. I still sort-of disagree with you, but sort-of agree. I do think prescribers should be more careful about prescribing stimulants and that there are people receiving stimulants that don't need them. That being said I think there are many patients that benefit from thoughtful stimulant prescription and I don't think we should hastily make legislation to restrict prescriber's authority to use these medications. Overall rates of ADHD in the US are 7.2% for children and 2.5% for adults. Obviously you could look at different studies and get different numbers, but I don't think 7% is ""rampant"" over diagnosis, particularly since not everyone diagnosed with ADHD is on stimulants I'll concede that recently prescribing has increased dramatically, which is concerning. I suspect some of this increase has been from the ""pill-mill"" online companies that do rapid diagnosis without due diligence. I don't think that means you should take stimulant prescribing authority away from PCP's though. In fact I think a big part of the demand for these online companies is due to the poor accessibility of mental health. For individuals with ADHD, the way our medical system is set up is a nightmare. I know this is just anecdotal evidence, but here's my experience: Get told (frequently) as a kid that I ""probably have ADHD but need to tough it out."" Family didn't believe in mental health medications. Survive school and college bc I'm interested in the subjects but w/ horrible coping mechanisms like cramming and staying up all night, doing papers the day before they're due. Self-medicated with coffee to the point of PVC's. Finally realize that the way I'm coping with my ADHD isn't helpful or healthy. Literally spend a year and a half to get a PCP who sends me to a therapist who sends me to neuropsychiatric testing. Finally settle on methylphenidate which is life-changing. But I have to remember every 30 days to go to the pharmacy to fill it. Usually remember ~ 1-2 weeks late. Then every three months have to see the doctor to re-prescribe it. Also usually late on that. And navigating phone calls and appointments is a nightmare but it works ok for several years until I move. Then run out. Over a year until I get a new PCP. They just need records from my old one. Takes me 6 months to make the like 10 minute phone call and make it happen. Works for 3 years, then move. Repeat. Then move again, and repeat. So currently I haven't taken methylphenidate in over a year bc I still need to get the records to my new new new PCP. And the thing is, fortunately, I don't like taking methylphenidate and don't need it to do my job. But things like housework, taxes, etc, I literally can't do. And the thing is, from that sob story about you might think I'm a low functioning individual. But each of those moves I mentioned was for internship, residency, fellowship, and attending. So if a medical professional has that much suffering and difficulty managing a legitimate medical condition, imagine how much difficulty a typical layperson has. Anyways, sorry for the book I just wrote. I think I just get ""triggered"" (I hate that word) when I feel like healthcare professionals dismiss the efficacy of stimulants on ADHD. I can live my life without them (as I am currently) but run the risk of poor personal life scheduling and planning and end up hyper-focusing on stuff that doesn't matter (i.e. this Reddit discussion) rather than doing things I need to do. Anyways I'm going to go drink a Red Bull and go to bed.

230,OpiatesRecovery,"Hey! First off lemme say I am SO proud of you for recognizing that you have a problem, before it becomes too problematic. I burned a lot of bridges and stole hundreds and hundreds of pills from my dad over the years, and almost entirely lost my parents as a result (which might have been a blessing bc they're narcissistic assholes but that's a conversation I've already had on Reddit lol.) So you already know it's not gonna be easy, but please know you CAN do this. Do you have insurance? My BEST advice is to see a doctor. Tell them you're trying to get clean, and ask if they can give you comfort medication while you ride it out. Assuming you aren't on any other medications that may interact, though I take antidepressants and several other meds and none of these interfere with them, the following list is the meds my doctor prescribed me for withdrawal. I wanted to post this here because I guarantee you're not the only person who is holding this question in their heart, deathly afraid of that next step. There is hope, and you can make yourself as comfortable as possible with these drugs: For anxiety/increased blood pressure, ask for Catapres. (Generic: Clonidine) It's an Alpha-2-Agonist. It mimics norepinephrine in the body and provides a calming effect. For restless legs, ask for Mirapex. (Generic: Pramipexole) Mirapex is a dopamine agonist. Restless legs are caused by a lack of dopamine, which happens because your body has begun to rely on the opiates for that dopamine hit. For insomnia and runny nose, ask for Vistaril. (Generic: Hydroxyzine) This one is an antihistamine. When you're in withdrawal, your body is confused and in crisis. You produce histamine, which can cause dermatitis, runny nose, the same symptoms as an allergic reaction. It's also got sedative properties, (think Benadryl/Z-quil) so it's good for the insomnia as well. If pain is still an issue for you, ask for Voltaren. Regular opiate use makes your body's pain receptors work overtime to communicate to you that there is a problem. Thus, opiate addiction can actually make chronic pain worse. Voltaren is an NSAID like ibuprofenвЂ¦ if ibuprofen was a body builder. That's just my opinion, but it's kept me in considerably less pain than I usually am in, for now seven straight years of sobriety. Alternate taking an NSAID and acetaminophen. They can be taken closer together than two doses of one or the other, because NSAIDS are filtered through the kidneys, while Tylenol/Paracetamol is taken care of by the liver. For diarrhea, you can get Imodium (Generic: Loperamide) over the counter. I found boxes at my local dollar store for way cheaper than what a prescription would have cost. However, it can be prescribed, so if your insurance will cover it, take advantage of that. For nausea, ask for Zofran (Generic: Ondansetron) since you're already abusing Promethazine. These are both antiemetics, though Promethazine also contains antihistamine. If you are more than nauseated and you can't keep anything down, Zofran can be prescribed as a dissolvable tablet that you put under your tongue. It's a gross ""grape"" flavorвЂ¦but it does the trick way more quickly than swallowing one, and you don't run the risk of throwing it back up before it's had a chance to take effect. After you've gone through 72-ish hours of withdrawal, you'll reach the point where you can manage with a medication like Suboxone (Generic: Buprenorphine with Naloxone.) Suboxone is a synthetic opioid which takes precedence over other opioids in your receptors. The way my doctor explained it was, if you still have a considerable amount of opioid in your system, bupe will come in and rip it from your receptors and replace it, thereby throwing you into what is commonly referred to as PAWS, or Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome. You. Do. Not. Want. This. I've known two people who threw themselves into it, (one almost killed themselves because of it,) and I also have done it to myself once, before I understood how all of this worked. I spent hours hovering over the toilet, throwing up, cold sweats, shivers and tremors, insomnia and HORRID anxiety. I honestly would have put myself in a medically induced coma if I could have, to get through the PAWS. Personally, I HIGHLY recommend skipping the suboxone altogether, and opting for Sublocade. It's a once-a-month injection of a resinous liquid that hardens into a small ball under your skin, and over the course of a month, releases buprenorphine into your system. This helps take the pressure off of your ability to resist buying the oxy, because if you do use an opiate while on sublocade, remember how bupe takes precedence in your opioid receptors? You will no longer be able to get high from the oxy, or much pain relief, and you'll rather quickly be able to focus on the next part, which is putting in the work mentally and emotionally, to assure this doesn't ever happen again. Bonus: Sublocade is AMAZING for coming off of suboxone if you're on it and you don't want to be. I tried to come off my suboxone on my own, and I had some of the worst withdrawal I've ever had. My doctor suggested Sublocade specifically because of its success at bringing people off of suboxone with little to NO side effects. I was flabbergasted at how well it worked. I wish you the absolute best of luck!! And again, very much proud of you, !!",1,1,you can make yourself as comfortable as possible with these drugs,-1
231,AskDocs,"Hey, I'm not a doctor, but I have had similar issues in the past and there were two over the counter treatments that helped me. The first is simethicone - interestingly, this medication doesn't reduce gas - it reduces foaming in the intestines, so instead of lots of bubbles of gas the bubbles merge into a small number of larger bubbles, so instead of lots of small farts you get a few large ones. I know that doesn't seem like a big deal but it really is! It helps so much. This is a common medication given to babies for the same issue. The other is activated charcoal - often this is formulated with simethicone as well. This actually is meant to reduce gas. Note that activated charcoal prevents other medications from being absorbed - so you can't take it with other medications. Obviously if you use other medications, consult a doc on when to take this in conjunction, if at all. For me, simethicone made all the difference. I'd also say definitely get an appointment with a gastroenterologist, and before you go, log the farts (really!) for a day or at least a good number of hours. That way when you say you're passing gas all the time, they won't think you're exaggerating and will actually understand the problem. There is IBS-G (irritable bowel syndrome - gas), and that may be it, but there's also other issues. You should absolutely seek medical help for this! Finally, I found that drinking lots of carbonated beverages really made it worse for me, which makes sense as they're full of gas! Again, I am not a doctor, and am telling you what helped me and was advised by gastro docs.",1,1,simethicone made all the difference,-1

I'm assuming you're not on any regular medications or have underlying health conditions. For the cough, you can try dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant) to help calm it down. As for the reflux, avoid lying down for at least 2вЂ“3 hours after eating, headrest litttle bit up while sleeping. You could also use an OTC H2 blocker like famotidine to reduce stomach acid and lessen irritation if it comes up. For pain and discomfort, acetaminophen can help. Gargling with warm salt water or drinking a honey-lemon warm water mixture can soothe your throat. Increasing the humidity in your home with a humidifier might also ease your symptoms. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if things aren't better in 7 days, it's a good idea to consult your GP.",1,1,"It's likely self-limiting...

235,Drugs,"Hi OP, since you're getting crap answers here's a proper one. Your ex sounds like he had a habit of low grade opiates and benzos. Now, I can't judge as I use benzos for medication- and they legit help me in life. I take Diazepam. It basically helps my mind stop racing, overthinking, it's great to help me sleep. It also helps in situations like if I'm nervous presenting in front of my whole company. Or for example, I'm stressed out about shopping and tired, impatient already and can't cope or have the patience with my wife trying on a 100 shoes and people bustling past me etc. It's anti anxiety. It's the same with the alprazolam and clonazepam. The first paragraph are low opiates. These can help numb pain but become addictive so become hard to stop. They're not harder opiates like Oxy or H. Codeine is available over the counter where I am. The morphine is weak. I would conclude your ex had issues, coping with his day to day so used them to self medicate.

Keep your fluids up which is wise advice regardless and try not to other think it, analysing ""Am I feeling x?"" Over and over. Personally speaking you can manifest all sorts of ills if you give it too much consideration. I have stepped of codeine at significantly higher doses and have managed, and I haven't. When I haven't it's been due to my preoccupation with expecting the worst.

240,AskDocs,"Hi! Fellow adhd er and then some here! It's common for us to forget if we took our meds. It's ok! Happens to me often and I now keep one daily dose containers since I take several medications a day and I take 30mg ER and 30mg IR a day. If I'm reading correctly, you're prescribed to take two daily? Right? It says in the post Xs two unless you were clarifying that's your concern for today? Either way, I would take your second dose if you're questioning if you doubled the first and truly wouldn't be worried if you normally take two a day anyway. Anxiety tends to be a comorbidity for us with adhd especially anxiety over forgetting things. ( I'm just generally anxious, but one of my worries is that because of my ADHD I can be quite forgetful and then I worry about worrying and worrying about forgetting. You know how it goes.) It's hard to tell if what you're describing is lack of second dose or bc you double dosed, but remind yourself it'll slowly start wearing off and the extended release is a bit different than it would be if you took two instant release for example. It happens to the best of us, but nothing major is going to come of it other than feeling a bit off especially if you are used to taking two a day (just not at once) You can always call your prescribing doctor or pharmacist if you're concerned, but I can reassure you, this isn't uncommon for adhd patients. There's several different things you can do to prevent the ""wait did I take it??"" days. For me, having two daily weekly dose containers (since I take several meds two times a day it could be confusing fast) and just setting out your daily doses each week. They also make pill bottle caps that have counters on them, or I'm sure you could ask your doctor next time you see them of any other tips and tricks.

They said it was a great work life balance and you can get a great schedule. LOL.

245,AskDocs,"Hi, I'm not a doctor. I have an anxiety disorder so I know something about dealing with confusing physical symptoms. I wouldn't say ignoring is the right strategy. But focussing on it all the time and stressing about it also isn't helpful. I say ignoring isn't the right strategy because with anxiety, it's usually communicating something to you. You won't always know what that is because sometimes symptoms come a bit delayed, which makes it hard to know why they started. Ignoring it also won't make your nervous system any calmer. But there are strategies you can learn for how to respond to symptoms. Like breathing exercises, doing something that you enjoy and makes you relaxed, writing about what's going on in your life/mind, doing some form of exercise. So basically: respond not ignore. Respond by helping your body and brain calm down by doing things you know help you with that. These are things you can learn in therapy. Medication can also help when your strategies are not enough on their own. Through therapy can also possibly learn to understand why this started in the first place. You can also learn if you perhaps have certain triggers for it which you can learn to accommodate yourself for, so you can decrease the amount of symptoms you experience. Just as an add on to therapy and medication: I also find using the Finch app helpful (finchcare.com). It's a self-care app that includes some of the exercises you can learn in therapy to manage anxiety, like breathing or grounding exercises. I'm not sure if you would find it helpful but it would be a loss not the suggest it if it could possibly also aide you. It's really confusing to deal with physical symptoms that are caused by anxiety, especially if you don't consciously feel particularly anxious or even have anxious thoughts. That's usually what people think anxiety entails. But anxiety is very much a physical response to stressful things, even if you're not aware of what triggers it. Your body can and will still respond. It's confusing. I wish you all the best on your journey towards feeling better.",1,1,Medication can also help when your strategies are not enough on their own,-1

264,ADHD,"I (36M, 2e) was diagnosed at 6 and started medication pretty much immediately and it was extremely helpful, until I would miss a dose. I think the most important thing for me was that my parents would put me on a 'Ritalin holiday' every summer once school was over and I would restart the meds 2-3 weeks before classes resumed. This is probably why I decided, and was able, to take myself off the meds freshman year of HS. I got tired of how poorly things would go when I missed a dose and, having at some point transitioned to Adderall XR, was also experiencing some extreme mood swings around 5 pm when the meds would start to wear off. I have a distinct memory of a particularly bad day where I was kicked out of class and spent the remainder of the time pacing around in a thought loop about how I was fucking up again and I hated this and it was so much worse than when I just stopped taking the meds altogether over the summer. I did pretty well overall with the rest of HS and College. I had, apparently, developed numerous coping mechanisms and tools/techniques over the years and was able to leverage my 'gifted' mind to compensate when the symptoms interfered with school. I did quite well into adulthood until around 30, when I started to notice that I was self-medicating with an energy drink at breakfast and lunch every day. So I decided to re-establish a PCP and talked to them about getting back on meds and it's made a huge difference. I'm still not sure what 'wall' I hit 5-6 years ago that tripped me up, but I have since realized that over the last 10 years my extremely unsupportive and unsympathetic work environment has systematically dismantled my ability to engage with the coping mechanisms and tools/techniques I used to benefit from by pushing my past the point where my intellect could compensate.

They also appeared to be pointing to the problem of employment with ADHD--most jobs want people with great executive function, and only some people with ADHD are lucky enough to get hired into jobs they can do consistently.

Aussies love their pub lunches. both extremely functional in their jobs and well respected by their peers. Socially, alcohol took away their children. My brother and I are minimal contact with them and we hardly visit. Alcohol also took away their ability to socialise whilst sober: they always felt they needed a vice to relax and never learnt coping techniques. They can't take back the abuse they inflicted on me and in some instances don't even remember because they were so drunk Physically the booze took their health. My mom especially is bad.

I am over the top stressed about so many things that my back is killing me from just worrying. The panic attacks causes my whole body to start shaking like I was out in the freezing cold naked. It is unbearable and I have to do something. I usually can take an otc pill like Benadryl or something like that to help me calm down, sometimes it works, sometimes not. I try to work myself through these episodes with out taking anything. But sometimes it is out of control. I am saving these 6 pills as my trip starts in 36 hours and I want as much ammo as I can to get me through this next 6 weeks. As reference I have received this 10 pills about 4 months ago so I do spread them out. When I get back from this trip, I plan on seeking out someone who can help me with this anxiety.

321,OpiatesRecovery,"I got hooked on Tramadol when I was living in Mexico during the covid pandemic. Mexico was still pretty open compared to the U.S. so I moved down there for 9 months during the height of the pandemic. You can buy Tramadol down there over the counter from pretty much any pharmacy. I broke two bones in my left foot in a scooter accident and used that as the reason to buy them from the pharmacist, since they always asked why I needed them. At first they actually helped with my broken foot, even though the doctor said I didn't need them, I was actually in some pain and could't walk. Over time, however, I realized that I was taking too many of them and decided that I needed to stop. What I did, which is what I suggest you do as well, was to first get rid of all of the Tramadol in my apartment. I knew that if there were any around me I would find and take them, which reminds me of that scene in Dopesick where the doctor breaks his glass cabinet to get his pills which he had previously locked. I didn't just throw them away, I actually had a friend of mine come over and physically take them with him. That was step one, get rid of all the pills from my house. Step two was to get through the withdrawal symptoms and get off the drug once and for all. The first couple of days were rough and especially at night. I couldn't sleep and felt like crap. It was up there with the worst I've ever felt and it was 100% because of the pills and not my foot, which was on the way to healing by then. After a few days, I felt better and really only felt bad at night during those first few nights without the drug. The third step was then to avoid relapsing. This was challenging because there are pharmacies on every street corner in Mexico and the drugs were cheap. So my advice to getting off Tramadol or really any Opioid for that matter is threefold. Get rid of all access to the drugs, get through the withdrawal symptoms which are usually the worst during the first few days and then prevent yourself from relapsing. Step three may be the hardest but what I've found to be most effective to prevent relapsing is, whenever I had a thought of ""I should buy some Tramadol today"", I realized that those thoughts weren't really myself thinking them, but rather that reptilian part of the brain that only seeks pleasure. There is something called the addictive voice recognition technique which you could look up, but I basically just described it. When I reminded myself of how bad I felt when I was going through the withdrawals, it made it much easier to avoid taking the drug, because I was now associating the drug with pain, rather than pleasure. See how that works? Anyway, I hope my story helps you. Since I've been back from Mexico I haven't used Tramadol and haven't even thought about it other than coming across this thread. Lastly, it may be a good idea to replace your weekend Tramadol habit with something more productive. Have you tried yoga? Do you lift weights? You could try Bikram yoga I think it's called which is yoga in a hot room. That shit makes you feel high as f\* k after and is good for your heart and brain.",1,1,At first they actually helped with my broken foot,-1

331,pharmacy,"I hate this reply. Obesity IS a failure. Whether it is a ""moral"" failure or not is an academic debate, but it certainly reflects an inability. Weight loss is extremely simple at its base - calories in, calories out (CICO). You talk about genetics, culture, socio-economic class as if any of those things violate the fundamental laws of thermodynamics. Your wife doesn't, either. If you burn more calories than you consume, you lose weight. Period. End of story. If you can find me a patient that can maintain 500lbs on a daily caloric intake of 400 calories, we have solved the mystery of perpetual energy and will win a Nobel prize. The problem is that so many people (nearly 44% of Americans are obese) are incapable of consuming fewer calories than they burn. Why? Nutritional illiteracy is a big problem. People don't even KNOW what a calorie is, how many calories they are eating and drinking, what their basal metabolic rate is etc. That's a failure. That's a failure of knowledge. For some people it's not nutritional illiteracy - it's food addiction. They have crippling mental health issues and they self medicate by binge eating. The dopamine that is released from excess calorie consumption is substantial, and they can fill the emotional voids in their lives with literal food. My 600lb Life is a wonderful case study on how often morbid obesity is the result of severe mental health dysfunction. But that, too, is a failure, is it not? A failure to properly address, treat and overcome mental illness? Most of our morbidly obese patients lose more weight after therapy than after gastric bypass surgery. They lose the weight, initially, but haven't done the fundamental mental health work and then just put it right back on. That's the problem with Ozempic. People aren't doing the work. It's a bandaid fix. They're losing weight but not because they're eating better, doing more exercise, becoming more nutritionally literate or addressing their mental health problems. They're losing weight passively. After they discontinue the drug, they will be right back to where they started. And, more importantly, whatever ""failure"" has caused their morbid obesity in the first place is, in almost every case it seems, not being addressed. Someone's ""culture"" doesn't make them 600lbs. Eating 5500 kcal per day did. What ""culture"" massively incentivizes pathological overeating? I have an ex girlfriend who was Dominican / Puerto Rican, cultures famously known for huge family cookouts and a culture centered around the social sharing of food. She was about 98lbs. You can go to a big family cookout, have a bit of BBQ chicken and some cole slaw, and socialize. No one is forcing you to eat 6000 calories of lasagna. Someone's ""socioeconomic status"" is not a valid justification for being 600lbs, either. Yes, statistically, the poorest people are the heaviest. But this goes right back to nutritional literacy. People poor is an excuse for being ignorant. You can be poor and educate yourself about nutrition. Thousands of free resources available. And no, it's not ""expensive"" to eat more healthily. In fact, it's cheaper, since you're eating less. Want to eat that McDonald's? Fine. Take one bun off the burger, pass on the fries. Just saved yourself 600 calories and 1200mg of sodium. Didn't cost you a thing.

336,Anxiety,"I have episodes around every 1-2 years. They seem to last about 2 weeks and then slowly recover. Truly terrible to experience and docs are useless. I am in my 40s now and have had them since I was a teen but never paid proper attention to them or detailed them. I used to self medicate them with alcohol which made them initially stop but ended up increasing them as the anxiety from the alcohol hangover exacerbated the anxiety. I did this for about twenty years but generally didn't drink much between times. I did have some bad episodes driven by trying to control anxiety with alcohol - I wouldn't recommend this approach to anyone. In my 20s I had to be medically detoxed due to the amount I was consuming. I was ok for around 15 years with the odd short lived panic episode (3-7 days) and I was on Zoloft. However I think the ssri stopped working around 5 years ago and since then I have had a bad anxiety episode around every year to 18 months. I once again foolishly tried to use alcohol to calm things but ended up in hospital for a detox on two occasions. Despite my contact with drs they have generally given me short doses of small amounts of Valium and I was once put on pregabalin - which did absolutely nothing for me despite working up to 300mg a day. As such I decided I have no option to control my anxiety - without killing my liver and making me stumble around drunk all time by self prescribing Valium (getting this regularly in my country is like trying to get blood from a stone). Even though I have these severe episodes I do have constant underlying anxiety also. I usually take 5mg a day on average - sometimes cutting down to nothing for a few days, sometimes raising the dose if the anxiety becomes intolerable. Last week I had another episode - which I am still in the midst of - and I can only be grateful that I have access to Valium during this period, otherwise I would be back to using vodka. It's been a week so far and I am feeling a little bit like I am coming out of it, but to do this I have had to use 15-20mg of Valium a day - I know this isn't an enormous dose but it is more than I am generally comfortable with using. I am trying to see a psychiatrist but they haven't got back to me yet to make an appointment. I would ideally like to get onto klonopin as I believe it lasts longer than Valium and will help better with my underlying anxiety and prevent me from having these flare ups - which are debilitating and I cannot get out of bed for days and tend to loose a lot of weight due to the anxiety making me nauseous and also lack of appetite. I am also considering trying a new ssri. I am honestly so sick and tired of these episodes. It is like I cannot think straight, impending doom, etc. much like everyone else has described.",1,1,I used to self medicate them with alcohol which made them initially stop but ended up increasing them as the anxiety from the alcohol hangover exacerbated the anxiety… I wouldn't recommend this approach to anyone.,-1

I like that I'm interested in learning, have an excellent memory for theoretical knowledge, and can apply it years later, but it also can interfere with my daily life), have self medicated since high school which has turned into a hardcore drug addiction, and in my adult years have become extremely unorganized, haphazard, and irresponsible. Hard to tell if it's a result of the drugs or a symptom of ADHD that I use drugs to self-medicate (very unsuccessfully). The more people asked me if I was undiagnosed ADHD, I started to actually consider it, took a few online evaluations and found i pretty much fit the profile to a tee.

Go to the section below under possible advice, you never know until you call all of the closest doctors. Go to the sublocade assistance site and search for nearby doctors accepting this program. Possible solution? My advice to you is to find a dr that does sublocade injections. The first injection is usually 300mg, after that 100mg once per month. I'm down to around 50mg every 45-60 days now with a plan to be off completely by 2026. They have copay assistance programs, the injection has to be ordered for delivery to your dr. I think a lot more mainstream doctors are getting into prescribing subs and sublocade. This is the website I use, I have insurance now, they show as little as zero cost. You likely qualify. The dr I seen gave me a prescription for a few strips while they ordered the medicine. or Search sublocade assistance program. I've been on subs for so much longer than my initial addiction to pills, I absolutely traded one for another. The cycle of addiction for me was similar to pills, waking up, taking a strip, getting a little boost, then thinking the more I took the better I'd feel. Not true, I had plenty of times where I was out and had weeks to my next appt. Left one job, had no insurance for several months, doctors were extremely hard to find that were prescribing subs back then.

351,Anxiety,"I know this post is mostly about anxiety, and I'll get to that, but based on what you've mentioned about alcohol, I (and clearly other commenters) feel it's pertinent to address that first. Personally, I've tried self-medicating anx/dep with alcohol and weed since I was 15 (now 25). Not sober now, but I've spent the last two years trying my best. It's important to take addiction seriously, whether you're at-risk or have been through the wringer for decades. Anyway, GOOD ON YOU for being aware of your family history and being honest with yourself about the potential implications of drinking. As far as anxiety, staying sober is a GREAT first step. My advice: 1: Stay honest. With yourself, with family/a trusted adult, and a trusted friend. They care about you more than you will ever know. 2: Stay sober! Even if you aren't struggling now, you'd be surprised how effective peer pressure and the urge to self-medicate for anxiety can be, especially between the ages of 18-25. 3: Remember who you are. You have already shown great resilience and courage by posting here and admitting that you are struggling with anxiety. Stay true to your values and you will go far. 4: Take care of yourself. Sleep well, eat well, exercise well, but most importantly: find what works for YOU. There is no easy fix for anxiety that comes without consequences. There will never be one. True freedom from anxiety, depression, addiction, etc. only comes through discipline. It will be hard, but it will be worth it. 5: Forgive yourself! If you do mess up, remember that you are only human, just like anyone else. 6: Remember you are not alone. Talk to people who have experienced anxiety and/or addiction, including family members if they are comfortable with it. Ask them how they handled it (both their successes and failures). Talk to your friends about your family history and your anxiety, and explain why you are sober. You may not be the only one in your friend group who feels the same way! Help each other out. And if anyone doesn't support your sobriety or tries to belittle your struggle with anxiety, they are not a friend.

Be safe, be well, and good luck.",1,1,"Even if you aren't struggling now, you'd be surprised how effective peer pressure and the urge to self-medicate for anxiety can be… Like many others, my dismal journey from anxiety to addiction started just as you described your first sip.",-1

Your issue is neurotoxic damage (sounds scary, but dont worry, most of the world has it \[alcohol, cough, cough\] and they live just normal), changes in receptors up/down regulation etc made by your brain adapting to usage over time (this is what takes so long to straighten up) and also your depression. Depression itself changes how brain works, so its hard to tell which came first and is the real culprit here. Probably both. Werent you kinda addicted? Addiction fills a hole in your heart. If you take the substance away the hole stays and starts hurting like hell. Its common for people in recovery to have a lot of bad times and depressive thoughts at the start of getting better. Sadly there isnt a lot of research done on mephedrone, but we can reasonably asume that a lot of stuff about MDMA abuse and abuse recovery applies. I have remembered that maybe you should try NAC (shows very promising results in big 2g doses every day for depression) and maybe an antioxidant like ALA wouldnt hurt. But, while supplements have their place you probably need to help your whole body recover, so a good diet, sleep and general self care would be best for that, as your body probably needs everything. And doing sports is a thing for life, take it slow. Also not everybody have to be a bodybuilder, just do something that you enjoy, even if its just simple walks. Best wishes and dont lose hope.

373,OpiatesRecovery,"I seem to function so much better with a small amount of pharmas once in a while. I was addicted to fentanyl, not pharmas. I know how fucked it sounds for a person trying to be in recovery from fentanyl to say ""I can use opiate pills responsibly but I'm powerless over fentanyl."" They say you can't turn a pickle back into a cucumber. They say a lot of things. And a lot of those pithy sayings are totally valid and some of the ideas are paint-with-a-broad-brush-black-and-white godwashed simpleminded bullshit. That may also be helpful to some so it's truth to them and that is ok. I started working again recently. Lately (past month or so) It's hard/impossible to sit up even at the computer or stand up and move around the house. Showering is a nice to have because I can't stand up that long without getting dizzy. It's hard to focus mentally for as long as I am used to being able to focus. Like I cannot function. I really want to keep my job / be able to do it. I've been unemployed for a while because of the addiction and the pain disorder and I want to have a life which involves working at a professional job such as this one which is appropriate to my intellect education and skill set. So I took 2.5mg oxycodone yesterday and felt not high but how I imagine a normal person feels - no pain, not ""good,"" not buzzed, just normal, not constantly aware of multiple nagging painful areas, I was not as feeble and could move around and sit up better and for longer. But I felt too normal if that makes sense. Because I wasn't in pain and exhausted I did feel good and that scared me. So I did 1.25 oxycodone today. I still hurt, but I could sit up and focus ok. I went down in dosage because I was afraid to feel ""too normal"" - I don't want to risk triggering gollum mode/relapsing. I need to save these limited doses that I have for extreme situations like pain and fatigue induced suicidality, complete exhaustion and despair which will eventually lead to suicidality or period pains that make me cry and double over and faint and for which nothing over the counter works. I am working with various doctors on getting my hormones straight and my thyroid ok and trying to eat better to be less malnourished and my periods sorted etc etc etc- my whole system is off and the chronic pain condition is not having a good time either and interacts with the other problems. And, I'm also going to try to get into pain management to have something for the shitty pain days. I will do piss tests pill counts whatever idgaf - just let me have a life where I can actually wash myself, sit at the computer and get work done for a reasonable period of time and stand up and walk down the stairs without fainting or go up the stairs on two legs not hands and knees. I think I can be in recovery from street dope and participate in pain management. I take a bunch of other shit too (non narcotic) to manage the chronic pain condition but none of it really works that well except Trazodone for getting sleep which is really important is working ok. None of these meds are daily things because they will lose effect if taken daily. I don't count days or celebrate any sobriety date beyond generally being aware of my last street drug lapse for early sobriety physiological milestone tracking purposes. I don't or even consider myself a sober person because as I said I am unapologetically using bits of oxycodone here and there. (And smoking weed sometimes which has its place but I seem to get carried away with wake and baking and it interferes with rem sleep which I really need so I have committed to not going back to the dispensary for a while.) I do consider myself on a recovery journey and that includes recovery from the pain condition that led me to think fentanyl was an awesome idea in the first place. I was gonna kms and fentanyl made me want to keep living - if only so I could do more fentanyl - bahaha seriously fuck fentanyl and especially fuck all the garbage that it's adulterated with now ugh shit's so nasty.

On Saturday morning, I try to get out and do something physical, which helps significantly with the ""withdrawl"" symptoms. Even a light hike, walk with my dog, or walkabout at the farmers market is enough to get my blood flowing and wake me up. The point is to get me up and out. If I stay on the couch or in bed too long, I will get stuck, so I have to get up and get out. I will also have an extra cup of coffee on the weekends to supplement. I like to take the weekends off, when possible, for the following reasons. \- Create a small stockpile in case of shortages or in the case where I can't pick up my script due to travel. \- Keep my tolerance low. I try to stay on the lowest possible dose and I hat easking to up my dosage. \- After a long week, I get some really solid sleep over the weekend when I take a break from it. \- My brain equates taking the adderall to working, so when I'm on it I feel like I *need* to be working.

It's just a different set of circumstances). I would strongly advise never using alcohol to dull GAD or a panic attack. It is a slippery slope.

408,ADHD,"I was an extremely lucky kid whose mom knew something was wrong and went to the damn library to figure it out. I was, therefore, a five year old medicated in the early 90's. I regularly thank my mom for having the foresight to take care of me this way even as a tiny child. The medication was incredible. There's a reason it's the gold standard first line treatment. While not a cure-all, it's amazing to finally be able to wrangle your own brain. Because without it, it very much feels like your brain is constantly sabotaging or fighting you, and the meds give you a fighting chance to harness it. Listen, my whole family has ADHD, so I just assumed that any children I had would also have it. When I was pregnant and picking out our pediatrician, one of the things I looked for was a practice that had a protocol for ADHD, medication specifically. Not just because of my own experience, but because I run an ADHD group, and I'm in several others, and I see so many people who finally get meds as adults and wish they'd been able to get meds as children and wonder what their lives could've been. And many of them have so much anger at their parents for either missing the signs, or seeing the signs and doing nothing about it. I say this because I know how scary it is to choose a highly stigmatized medication for your little child. I totally get it. The thing is, our brains do so well with it. There's so much else that he'll need to figure out in terms of coping and strategies, which are necessary, but meds make all that so much more possible. And his life is only going to get harder from here. Another little note on stimulants-they are actually not that risky and super easy to trial! They will work immediately, like first day he tried them, even the first hour! And if there's side effects or issues, they're out of the system in like a day. And there's a lot of wiggle room and different meds to trial, so while getting the dosage right can be a bit of work, it's awesome that there are so many options with relatively low risk (as long as there are no specific-to-him issues, which his doctor will navigate). So yes, highly recommend meds first and foremost, then working on the rest. OH and you should also look at the stats on the risks of not medicating, because it turns out that a lot of people, possibly including your fiance, end up with addiction issues as a way of self-medicating. I only say this because, paradoxically, the meds are demonstrably helpful in preventing the outcome he fears. Best of luck to you all!!!",1,1,meds are demonstrably helpful in preventing the outcome he fears,people end up with addiction issues as a way of self-medicating

410,OpiatesRecovery,"I was clean 20 plus years off of a $1000 a day heroin habit in the early 90's. I relapsed slowly with pills. I told myself it wasn't a real relapse. Then I got on methadone at 22 years off of heroin. Then at 25 years off of heroin I relapsed on fentanyl with xylazine (tranq dope) I got sores and thought this is the end. Finally had a rational thought one day after reading here on Reddit that I'd try suboxone. My point isвЂ¦. I felt exactly the way you did. I tooth and nailed life. I got married clean, had 3 kids clean, got divorced clean. It wasn't until I started with codeine pills in France because they were over the counter that I started to ""feel"" better. I wish I tried suboxone before relapsing but I was always afraid to go into a clinic. On the streets in the 90's they called methadone liquid cuffs. I was always afraid of doing MAT. I went to many rehabs and lived in a halfway house. The halfway house tossed me into a psychiatric hospital for auditory hallucinations. I wish I could go back in time and put myself on suboxone. I too was a poly substance user (Xanax, Clonazepam, gabapentin) and the benzodiazepine withdrawals are just starting to be understood by the medical community. Treating OUD should NOT be a stigma. If you need the medication take it, it might make a 25 year clean person a clean person for life. I can't go back in time, but I learned my lesson. I'm 50 plus years old, my kids are almost all in college, and I still relapsed on the ""black magic"" Life happens and I probably had great coping mechanisms, BUT I never physically felt ok. Who knows how long protracted withdrawal lasts and what happens to our brains neuropathways? I think some people can get clean and bounce back and other people need assistance with MAT. I fought MAT because of NA. I was deeply involved in the 12 steps. I thought if I didn't follow the 12 steps exactly that I would relapse. The brightest addiction doctors out there, with real hands on experience would suggest suboxone for someone like you. I might get reamed for saying this, but suboxone has been exceptionally beneficial for me. I call it the miracle drug. I wish you all the best and sending you positive vibes, courage and strength!

What you describe with the food and liquid bolus getting stuck, and yiu had possible relief with continuous PPI therapy, let's me think that there are two possibilities; and each can coexist. 1. Lower esophageal sphincter spasm/ diffuse esophageal spasm 2. Barrett esophagus. DES can cause your symptoms of intermittent, painful dysphgia. Barrett is just replacement of normal squamous layering of the esophagus with the gastric type of cells, as a protective mechanism for GERD.

My suggestion would be that you get an evaluation from an Gastro specialist when it becomes convinient to you. You would need a esophagoscopy to be able to see what is wrong. You can try an alternate day or once in 3 day regimen with PPI and see if your symptoms remain abated. Edit: eosinophilic esophagitis can also have a similar presentation. 1.

446,ADHD,"I'm 48F and definitely yes. I feel like I never drink enough water. And if you are planning on Adderall for life, there are risks to long-term usage. I'm curious about your dosage? Not saying it's normal to be dehydrated, but I care about our kidneys ?? I have these symptoms when I'm not drinking enough water: Increased thirst Dry mouth and throat Dark yellow urine Feeling unusually tired or lethargic Dizziness or lightheadedness Confusion or difficulty concentrating Dry skin Headaches Ref: Also, not listed there, as a woman, I can tell a difference with my menstrual cycle too. Your post helped me reflect on my prescribed Adderral history. Thank you. Not sure if this story helps or not, but I am wondering what the reaction is in our bodies after decades of Adderral usage? My dad popped Aleves back in the day like candy because it was supposedly safe. Now he's 83 and his gut lining is trashed from years of innocent NSAID OTC use. After my divorce 11 years ago, I was overprescribed in dosage wrt adderral and also got scripts to cope with other mental issues: depression, anxiety, insomnia - my doctor was a general practitioner in South Dakota, not strict rules back then, and I just didn't know what I didn't know. I got up to 45 XR a day on Adderral in about three months along with Xanax, Klonapin, Valium and moreвЂ¦ The combination of the meds and not taking good care of myself spun out of control b/c I was also drinking lots of caffeine and alcohol everyday too also Adderral no nos (coping with divorce was hard mentally and physically), so my kidneys and my liver were stressed out as much as my head was too. On top of frequent UTIs the side effects just kept ramping up. After about 6 months I quit all Rx meds for depression, insomnia, anxiety - as well as the Adderall. I detoxed on my own: ROUGH. But I got through it. Four years ago, perimenopause made my ADHD so much worse. I decided to go back on Adderall and my new psych doctor prescribed 10mg instant release - base dose - and that was too much for me: I had a headache with severe anger mood swings. My doc dropped the dose to 5 mg, yet that was not enough. We discovered 7.5 mg is my sweet spot. I haven't had to increase the dosage in 3 years and am allowed to take 3.25 mg - 7.5 mg in the afternoon as needed to manage ADHD. I don't take off days unless I forget. So my long winded point: it's up to us to know our bodies, check our dose, and consider the impacts of long term usage. Keep on keeping on! ?????United! Now where'd I leave my damned water bottle? ??",0,0,-1,-1
447,OpiatesRecovery,"I'm a 54 year old autistic male, also UK. I took Nurofen plus for a bad back вЂ” which spiralled into a 6/7 year addiction. At its height I was taking two large boxes a day - 64 tablets - although the fear of my stomach collapsing made me go cold turkey for a few days and then I went back to half the previous dose so I could be functional at work. A few weeks later the dose was creeping back up, so I did cold turkey for another 4/5 days, and halved it again. I had seen the doctor about it and he put me on 30mg codeine tablets on a tapering scheme, which I followed to an extent. But the next stressful interaction with anyone and my intake would bounce back up. I was working in a job where I had to deal with the public and think the stress of that as an autistic adult made it very difficult for me to taper. So I kept going with the cold turkey for 3-5 days and then halving the dose. It's more of a step down approach than a smooth taper. But it got me to where I am now: today is day 24 of no codeine. It is not easy. The cold turkey involves insomnia, hours of unpleasant withdrawal and an exciting new problem: restless leg (and arm) syndrome, especially bad at night. Added to these are the psychological aspects: fear, a feeling of being very alone (even with a supportive partner вЂ” they will be snoring while you're pacing the floor all night), and a Dementor-level of hopelessness which can seem overwhelming and time itself seems to slow down in the small hours. BUT it is doable. None of this will kill you. Ibuprofen overdosing will. Please stop ingesting ibuprofen at these levels. I dissolved tablets in cold water. Codeine is soluble but ibuprofen is not. The ibuprofen will sink to the bottom, or you can filter it out with a coffee press. I say this only to stop you doing damage to your stomach. Please use this advice as a part of stepping off. If tapering doesn't work for you then go cold turkey for 3-5 days knowing you can go back to using half the dose and you will be functional. It's not easy but it is doable. This is not medical advice, but there are some things that have helped me: writing down a daily log of everything good and bad. It helps to see how the experience is changing and to note any improvements. You can easily get lost in it all and forget that day 12 was better than day 6. After lots of research (one thing I'm very good at) I took magnesium (helps with the restless leg/arms), lots of vitamin C (google ""vitamin C for opioid withdrawal"" but bear in mind the diarrhoea is awful), lots of vitamin D, and take lots of iron (I'm taking four or five tablets a day just after having vitamin C because the acid helps uptake of iron). I am drinking more water than ever. This seems to help. I'm also taking long walks with the dog вЂ” even when I don't feel like it at 4am, but exercise helps. Your body will be craving dopamine. It's this that prompts the insomnia and restless leg. So do things that give you a little dopamine boost: have your favourite snacks and movies or games at the ready, ICE LOLLIES (no idea why but an ice lolly helped with cravings and even sleep) a walk,music on your headphones, lots of massage, and yes masturbation вЂ” sorry but it works. These will start to build up your natural trigger of dopamine which has been robbed by codeine. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and any type of sleeping tablet because they all make the restless leg thing a LOT worse, so you'll have a sleepy head but a body that will not be able to sit still вЂ” worst experience of my life. For sleep I have taken CBD, valerian root, and sometimes ashwagandha, mint tea. Herbal things for relaxing are okay. But even then, sleep will be problematic. I have read of people taking Kwells to help with the restless leg but I haven't tried it myself. Imodium is another thing that some people swear by. I took some in the early days when the diarrhoea was bad but it is an opioid-like relaxant. But it can also be addictive and lengthen out withdrawal so be careful with that. I've read that at normal doses it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, and it did give me some relief from withdrawal, but it has its own risks and some people end up taking dozens which is very bad. If you find the insomnia to be very bad you can see a doctor about Zopiclone. They'll give a week's worth to get you through. Sorry for the very long post, but I am absolutely convinced that if I can get to 24 days clean, anyone can. I felt hopeless. I wanted to give up many times. I know you feel you have an addictive personality. For me I thought the same but I actually think it's just self medicating in order to cope with a normie world. Because part of autism includes a type of resolute stubbornness вЂ” we like things a certain way. OCD can also be seen as a type of stubbornness вЂ” not to be rude or flippant but there was no moving my OCD mum off her habits. Use these qualities you already possess. Use your natural skill set to undo this damaging pattern. You are not your addiction. You can let it go. Be stubborn about not using codeine the way you have been. You can do this.

451,OpiatesRecovery,"I'm assuming if you're getting 30mg codeine, then it's pure codeine without any paracetamol/APAP in it? If the pills are just straight codeine, then physically there's no major damage. Though the constipation from it could cause secondary issues, if you don't manage that well. But yeah, it's not super dangerous physically if it's straight codeine. However, as you've described, the damage comes in the form of the dependency you've built up. If it were just straight physical dependence as a result of treating your legit pain, then that's one thing. But the mental dependence and the self-medicating your anxiety problems are where the real issues lie, especially with your acknowledgement that you can treat your pain with non-opioid medication. Using opioids to cope with life is what leads a great many of us into addiction and keeps us tied to these drugs. If you can't cope with life unless you're high on codeine, there's a problem. I did the same thing for a long time. You might not consider yourself high but trust me, it's the high/euphoria etc that helps you to cope with your anxiety. If all you got from codeine was pain relief like a non-opioid painkiller, you wouldn't use it to cope with anxiety. It took me a few years to build a tolerance but eventually codeine no longer did anything for me anxiety-wise and I had to move on to a stronger opioid for the same effect. This will happen to you the more you rely on it for coping for daily life. Are you receiving any treatment for your anxiety? If not, I would strongly recommend you pursue that. I think you know it's unhealthy to be using opioids in this way, and you're right to be concerned. Seek help for the the anxiety and the underlying reasons for it and learn healthy ways to cope. You'll be happier in the long term by addressing this, if nothing else.

452,OpiatesRecovery,"I'm based in the UK and have gone through withdrawal so many times (Morphine), tried everything and was finally able to stop. It was absolutely the worst thing I've ever experienced but I was able to do it because I really wanted it. I would say you have three options... to go cold turkey and treat it like an illness (I eventually found this the easiest as I couldn't trust myself to taper effectively and had no medical supervision). If you choose this, I will send you all of the UK specific information that will help you get through it (medications, vitamins, preperation). With your dosage and addiction time, I reckon you'd be back to almost 100% normal in 14-16 days, though withdrawal is patient-specific and subjective. The second option is to continue with what sounds like an uncomfortable taper for you... I couldn't do it because I didn't have 6 months to feel less than normal (work etc.), also if you find yourself topping up at pharmacies with OTC stuff, then it defeats the point (I know how hard it is, knowing you can walk into Boots and buy it). The third option is nuclear; if you really can't trust yourself with the first two, I must suggest that you refer yourself to your local Drug and Alcohol service (I can help you with this) and have a conversation with the doctor about a low dose Methadone or Buprenorphine course. This sounds absolutely crazy but is now standard practice for Codeine addicts who are unable to stop on their own... this becomes particularly pertinent if you aren't performing Cold Water Extractions on your codeine + ibuprofen or codeine + paracetamol tablets.... ingesting large quantities of Paracetamol will kill you, ingesting large quantities of Ibuprofen will cause stomach ulcers etc. Being on Methadone or Buprenorphine is completely preferable to those two outcomes.",1,0,-1,I eventually found this the easiest as I couldn't trust myself to taper effectively

When moving to bup you'll have to check the half life of 7OH, it will take a while to explain but essentially buprenorphine has a strong binding affinity meaning if taken too early it will rip the other opioid off your receptors and cause pwd.

I also have issues voiding urine the more constipated I get, and have to press hard and only little bits come back.

But a third variant means I POWER through stims super fast, like it's metabolized super fast in my body. I assume that's why I was a little coke fiend.

469,ADHD,"I'm probably going to make a post about this in the thread if I'm allowed but if you can afford it, I would suggest: 1: Check your labels! Generic brand companies are only required to have x amount of the main active ingredient in their formulas and any/all inactive ingredients can affect how the medicine dispenses in your body. How do I know this? I took an intro to pharmacology and it explicitly said this in the first couple chapters. If you have a generic from Amneal: in my experience it's complete crap and does not work. I personally had every side effect known to man with it and this is not the only medicine I've had that issue with from that labeler/manufacturer but once I switched to a different one, it worked so much better. 2. If switching to a different manufacturer of the generic doesn't work, i would probably ask if you can try the brand only of the medicine (if you can afford it). Generics aren't allowed to make exactly as the brand does which is why all the inactive ingredients often are different and again, they change how the medicine works. Talk to your doctor. 3. I would say if none of the above worked, then try either upping or lowering the dose at the discretion of your doctor. 4. If none of the above works, only then I would say to try something else and then follow the list again to ensure if you're getting what you need from your medicine and tell your doctor of any changes. 5. Finally, if all else fails and you still don't feel like it's helping, consider that there might be something more going on. ADHD is an issue that causes so many other symptoms in everyone that sometimes the issue you're experiencing might actually be the issue. Example: feeling depressed all the time vs adhd depression. Again, talk to your doctor So much of this is self reflection and being able to identify what is going on within ourselves.

Please note: I am not a medical professional nor do I claim to be one, but these are things I've learned over the years of being medicated for my adhd, working with both my therapist and psych and the things I've also read and studied in various college medical courses, so always always talk to your doctor about what is (potentially) right for you.

471,medical,"I'm so sorry for the response you've been getting from doctors. It sounds to me like you might have GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). For various reasons, stomach acid and sometimes food and drink from the stomach can escape up into the esophagus. It can be painful, burning, and can come with a lot of other symptoms. The egg white clear stuff is most likely mucous that your body is making as a means of protecting your esophagus from the stomach acid. Some things you can do to get some relief, avoid eating and drinking a lot of fluid within a couple hours of bedtime. Avoid spicy foods and heavy, greasy meals (especially later in the evening). Avoid overeating, but especially in the evening. If your symptoms most bother you at night or in the early morning, try sleeping on an incline, either by raising the head of your bed or by using pillows to prop yourself up. If you're in the US, you can also buy medicine over the counter, maybe try Pepcid AC (Famotidine) and take that a few hours before bed for a couple weeks and see if that helps with your symptoms.",1,1,It sounds to me like you might have GERD ...

You can also reach out to them for the depression. Some antidepressants help both anxiety and depression.

My mom was an alcoholic and I believe she was also using it to self medicate for anxiety. As for your mom's hair, that's got to be tough on her. I know someone that used certain vitamins and they really helped hair loss. She might be deficient in certain nutrients. Nutrafol is supposed to be good, too. A dermatologist can also help with that when she can financially swing it. If you can get her to a psychiatrist, I'm sure you could set up a payment plan to pay a little bit at a time.

I've brought it up to my doctor while in for other checkups (I did start some blood pressure meds which is why I was going in for the checkups) and (reluctantly) showed her some pictures I had taken of my BMs to show the blood amount and she said she wasn't really concerned. Even after it went on for like 2 months. She just said that unless I was feeling really bloated/cramped and/or the bleeding got a lot worse/darker then it was probably fine. I took some OTC stool softener for about a month (at her approval) and it helped with the bleeding but not with the frequency of my BMs. Needless to say, I'm still concerned.

You're super lucky that you're even getting pain meds. With my back got fucked, I was denied any decent meds, because the doctor was worried that I was ""drug seeking"". Ironically, because I couldn't get pain meds... I relapsed, and self medicated. It took me 8 years to go back to a doctor, and ACTUALLY follow directions/advice. Which... was to go into physical therapy, and take NSAIDS. I found naproxen worked the best for back pain, and I was taking 2 tabs twice a day WITH food and milk. Physical therapy was NOT what I thought it would be. Yeah, it's ""physical"" but IME it wasn't like doing strenuous ""exercise "". Quite the opposite. I went 2 - 3 times per week, with one hour sessions. At the time, I had 4 slipped disc's in my lower back with ""calcification"" fusing my sacrum to my pelvis AND fairly severe sciatica. I was in pain for a long time, and I couldn't even stand up straight. PT girl checked my range of motion, and explained how people with back pain, tend to do the opposite of what they need to do. I was practically a hunchback, always rubbing the knots in my lower back. I needed a super soft bed, and most nights were sleepless, with me turning into a ball/fetus, while crying. It SUCKED. But what I didn't know at the time, was that by ""guarding"" my injury, I was pinching more nerves, and pushing those disc's out further. Because of years of doing that, my muscle tensed up to ""hold"" that position - and grow a ton of pressure points/knots. So... after my first appointment, I was surprised when the only ""physical"" part of therapy, consisted of simply laying on my stomach, and getting a massage. Goal being - to straighten my back. After the massage, she hooked a tens unit with 4 electrode pads placed in the sore areas of my back. Then she placed a heating pad over the electrodes, then a lead vest (from radiology) over the heating pad. Next appointment was a little more strenuous, because she first showed me gow to do some simple stretches at home. Two that I remember, and worked. Very simple. First one was ""pelvic tilts"". Essentially you stand and hump the air. Lol. Second one was standing with my hands on my hips, and moving forward (like bowing) then leaning backwards, real slowly, with breaks. Next part of that session, she had me laying on my stomach again, but with my arms up and under my head. I laid there maybe 20 minutes when she came out with the tens unit, and heating pad. My choice to put my arms down by my side, or keep them under my head. Third appointment, I was able to lay on my stomach, and raise up onto my elbows. I did 30 seconds on and off, followed by a massage, and the tens set-up. With the mild home stretches, and tens set up, by my 4th appointment... I was able to lay on my stomach, and push up onto my hands like a half-assed push-up. 30 seconds on/off followed by the tens routine. 5th time, she showed me how to do the ""cat/cow"" stretch while on my hands and knees. Then she reminded how to stretch my hamstrings. Few weeks later, my back pain was pretty much cured. I do have times when I need to do a few days of stretching... but for the most part, I felt great! Once my pain was somewhat managed, I got on Suboxone and did well (by others standards) for almost 5 years. It was fairly amazing, and again... nothing like I thought it would be. It was more stretching than any real sort of physical activity. I feel foolish that I went so many years absolutely discounting PT.

But biggest thing is once the coke wears off, your ""bank"" of transmitters is completely empty, less than the low amount you already normally have. So anxiety goes into overdrive. Just takes time to refill the tank. Its the same with my adhd. My meds help throughout the day, but once they wear off i crash hard and have like MEGA adhd. (To the nitpickers i know this is a very over simplified explanation of very complex neurology, but despite research ongoing to the how and why of neurotransmitters being linked to things like adhd and anxiety, they have indeed been linked.

512,Anxiety,"If you do take it, definitely make sure you stay on top of any potential drug interactions that can occur, as it is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which increases serotonin levels in your brain. There are a lot of common OTC medications and medicated cocktails people usually are unaware of that affect the serotonin levels in your brain. Here are some examples to be mindful of: *Cough Medicines/Nasal Decongestants: Nyquil, Dayquil, Mucinex, Coricidin, Benadryl, Sudafed: there are more but these are the ones I know off the top of my head. They can contain dextromethorphan (major interaction, can increase risk of serotonin syndrome), phenylephrine (there are mixed studies but again can increase risk of serotonin syndrome), and pseudoephedrine (same mixed studies, but can increase risk of serotonin syndrome). This obviously varies based on the type of cough medicine/nasal decongestant, but most OTC ones contain some form of atleast one of these or similar. *Anti-nausea (some prescription, some OTC): Zofran (odansetron) major interaction, can cause serotonin syndrome (I still take this one occasionally but only at 4mg once a day if necessary). Dramamine (dimenhydrinate) can increase risk of CNS depression, but is listed as moderate. *Acid-reducers: Pepcid (famotidine), has moderate risk, can increase risk of a serious arrhythmia, although not sure which one. I take this all the time (and have my whole life) as I have very severe GERD but I've always been fine. *NSAIDs like Advil, Motrin (ibuprofen), Mobic (Meloxicam), Naprosyn (Naproxen), Celebrex (celecoxib): most NSAIDS can increase the risk of GI bleeding, but from my understanding it's usually only more worrisome at higher doses. I still take up to the maximum of 1200 mg ibuprofen/day when I'm sick or in pain, but never over that. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is a great alternative, but I've noticed it doesn't work as well for me, which is why I still take ibuprofen. *Alcohol: In ALL cases, no amount of alcohol is safe with Zoloft, as it majorly increases the risk of serotonin syndrome and I believe CNS depression as well. That being said, I notice I am usually fine if I have a beer or two but never over that. Maybe a margarita every once in awhile. I don't drink much anyways, so it doesn't bother me much. A lot of antidepressants interact with alcohol though so you probably won't be able to switch to another antidepressant without that being a major interaction. Just be very careful with this one especially. Always, ALWAYS talk to your doctor before you plan to mix any of these medications (and other prescriptions and OTC medications that interact with zoloft). I usually use drugs.com for reference (which is where I got most of my info in this comment) when not with my doctor, but there's other sites out there that may have more information. I typed all that out because I've been on other subreddits where many people were completely unaware of the risk of serotonin syndrome with Zoloft and taking cough suppressants specifically.. and some people actually did develop it. I would just hate for that to happen to you as well due to being uneducated. Pretty much everything interacts with Zoloft lol. Most of the time though, people are fine. But again, do everything at your own discretion and make sure your doctor agrees that the benefits outweigh the risk. Don't be afraid to ask questions about these interactions as they are always possible with antidepressants, regardless of which one you take. TL;DR Zoloft did wonders for my anxiety, depression, PTSD and ADHD after many traumatic events, kept me out of the hospital, but has its interesting moments. You have to be consistent and mindful of any drug interactions due to the increased risk of serotonin syndrome and other conditions with a lot of common medications (both OTC and prescription) and ALCOHOL!!! Also, don't go cold turkey, as much as you can help it. In any case, if the benefits outweigh the risk, or vice versa always consult with your doctor (usually psychiatrist or primary) and don't take medical advice from Reddit.. lol ??ok rant done! going to touch grass?? 2/2",1,1,There are a lot of common OTC medications and medicated cocktails people usually are unaware of that affect the serotonin levels in your brain.,-1

524,OpiatesRecovery,"In 2019, I had an operation when on Buprenorphine and explained my dosage to the consultant in advance, and to the surgeon and anaesthetist on the day. As far as I know they completely ignored me. The consultant gave me no advice in advance other than to keep the anaesthetist informed. I know he didn't put it in the notes because he said it wasn't necessary. After being told, the surgery team took no special measures on the day. Afterwards I spoke to the anaesthetist and he was quite apologetic. He believed that my dosage would not block the post-operative analgesia. Anyhow, what happened was that when I came round from the anaesthetic, they couldn't control the pain, and were unwilling to increase the fentanyl beyond the normal amount, despite the fact that they should have understood the blocking effect and my tolerance level (from opioid equivalence tables). Because the pain was uncontrolled, my blood pressure went through the roof. Eventually, they gave me Ketamine which worked well enough but by that time they decided that they had to give me a massive dose, which was a horrible experience for one reason or another. Time has moved on and surgery teams might be more familiar with the needs of Buprenorphine patients now, but ... 1 - They could have moved me to short-acting opioids in advance, so that the Buprenorphine would not have blocked my opioid receptors. 2 - There are opioids with even higher receptor affinity than Buprenorphine. Because so many people are on blockers, hospitals carry Sufentanil which has such a high opioid receptor affinity that it is effective on Buprenorphine and Naltrexone patients. This is difficult and risky and so is usually only done in emergencies. 3 - Probably the safest and least disruptive approach would have been to plan to use Ketamine from the start, rather than trying and failing to use fentanyl. That way my blood pressure and pain would have been under control from the outset. Finally, and I don't know about this, it might have been possible to control the pain with increased dosage or different route of administration of Buprenorphine. I was on 6mg/day, and perhaps this is already beyond the limit of its effectiveness as an analgesic. If my current detox fails, I'm thinking of carrying a card or bracelet with all the appropriate details of my Buprenorphine dosage etc. In my case, I also take 7 drugs every day to control diabetes and other chronic diseases, so I really should carry some information anyway. I am no longer self-medicating, so my hope would be that everything is in my NHS notes. Even the private clinic I use, sends updates to my GP. However, I'm not sure I would rely on that.

I have some personal experience with similar concerns so this will probably get long lol The side of my family that I suspect I got my ADHD from has a pretty consistent problem with addiction; my dad and 4/5 of his siblings faced alcoholism/nicotine addiction in particular. I strongly suspect that they were self-medicating, to the point of not making it past 50. That whole side was heavy on the ""we don't talk about our feelings""/""it's all in your head""/""psychology is a pseudoscience"" type nonsense so none of them were officially diagnosed with anything, but the ones I had met of my dad's generation fit a LOT of ADHD/Autism criteria. I have several cousins on that side who have been diagnosed with ADHD, taken stimulants without getting addicted, and struggle significantly less with alcoholism/smoking than our parents - which is to say most are teetotalers. Having been recently diagnosed with ADHD myself after raw-dogging life for 30 years, I was desperate for help. My doctor and I decided to try Adderall after Strattera (a non-stimulant) helped but not as much as I needed it to. I definitely fall into the 'more likely to forget the Adderall than get addicted to them' category, at least so far. I've felt almost giddy on it but in the ""omg it's working"" kind of way, not an ""omg I'm so high"" way. I look forward to it continuing to relieve some symptoms in the same way I look forward to the Tylenol kicking in when I've got a headache. In my limited non-professional experience, the flavor of ADHD in my family doesn't have addictive tendencies if we're medicated. Addiction is a many-faceted illness; I've witnessed enough of it to say that proper support goes a long way toward preventing it. In my case, my husband knows me so well that he can tell if my behavior is off in a bad way, and we have very open communication so I know he'll call me out. I've gone through countless med changes in our nearly-8-years together and he's seen me through some very dark days. I've never struggled with addiction with him by my side, but had some hospitalization-level-bad habits when I was with my ex and facing some of the most isolated days of my life.

You're not on a timeline. Progress isn't consistent - some days will be easier or more difficult than others. I failed at every aspect on and off, and I still don't always take great care of myself, but I'm better at being gentle with myself. I started eating better first, then moving my body more since it gave me a little more energy. I took short walks, long walks, went on runs. Some days I just stretched, others, nothing. I had to impose a time frame I'd allow before I'd force myself to pick back up. I was social even though it was uncomfortable. I still think it was a necessary piece of recovery to have other people treat me like a person. I also had to do things I used to enjoy intermittently until I enjoyed them again, and try new things. It didn't work for me to push through every single time because I needed the rest also, but I balanced the best I could. Then I started therapy and started going to a doctor again. I was put on antidepressants and eventually got diagnosed with ADHD and treated for that, which may not be part of your equation. It still took some weeks to feel comfortable after I was properly medicated. These days, I also take multiple mushroom supplements. Reishi, cordyceps, lion's mane, etc., seem to make a huge difference in my sleep, mood, and energy. My psychiatrist recommended live culture probiotics to rebalance because gut health and mental health are highly linked, which helped immensely after a few weeks. Now I eat yogurt with cultures. Also helps with poops. ?? My psychiatrist also recommended in-clinic ketamine to help relieve trauma (common underlying cause of addiction). It is the only psychedelic approved for trauma therapy where I am. Idk about other areas. I took a different route because I was worried it might feel good. If I hadn't made progress through other means, I would've taken the risk. I like to listen to Alan Watts on YouTube and cry when I get existential. Sometimes in joy, sometimes in sadness.

Dr Jill Krapf worked with Dr Goldman who was pretty much the one person doing formal trials on it for a long time. She now runs her own branch of their pricey specialty clinic and she posts allot on social media and I think had some longer talks out there as well and she trains other doctors, so she's a good source of latest recommendations aimed at a general audience- Look / ask for a dermatologist in your region that does LS, there are getting to be more out there. May have to call and ask at academic derm office, their websites often aren't very comprehensive. A derm will be and to parse the details from the biopsy report and if there is something different or additional going on from a skin disease perspective. Both gyn and derm are good to have consult. Some treatments others have tried, research for yourself and ask doc if it may be a fit - Elidel / Pimecrolimus - Rx is second line and couldn't beat clob in a trial so insurance may not pay for it but is hugely helpful for some. Ref: Patch test allergy testing - thru dermatologist Contact allergies can be causing or contributing to long-standing inflammation of such sensitive skin. Even ""free clear"" detergents, plain soaps etc can cause serious damage if someone has become sensitized to it. And the damage from one exposure can last for months. They can also see if inactive ingredient in your meds are causing problems, tho they try to use very neutral bases for those. Used to be hard to find seems more available now. Eliminate every possible irritant - self help as much as possible. Sounds like you've probably already done given your frustration, but the patch testing can help find unknown issues. But also even just everyday life friction can be tricky irritating - cotton boxers and loose pants, less exercise ( for a bit) etc, can help, very disruptive of course, so do what you can.

Asking questions about their addiction helps guide what to do. Everybody is different. For this one, it was tricky. I started off with12mg of bupenorphine and wanted more, but knew no help was coming. 1 mg of alprazolam starting off maybe an hour after no outcome from bup, was where you could start to see some effects. Depending on the person, and dosage and knowing everything that they occasionally take or take everyday and how they take it is key.

If somebody takes 2 mg of alprazolam with a gm of fentanyl occasionally and has no serious side effects, it might be time to experiment.

Recovery is multi faceted and I strongly encourage you to begin working on the psychological issues that you use DHC to manage and control. My use was all about self medicating mental pain, abuse, etc. It was all about escaping emotions and floating above my life as long as possible. I wasn't able to get into recovery proper until I worked on those things and made changes. SMART Recovery is the model my D A service use and it has been excellent. I've seen it work for a number of others there too, who have gone on to volunteer and run their own groups there. I know using a D A service probably isn't what you wanted to hear given your post, but addiction is truly a beast that we can rarely conquer alone. Things have changed a lot and it's happening from within the organisations, something I can confidently say from working in the environment, and I so I would urge you to give it another try and keep an open mind going in.",1,1,it helped me changed my life,My use was all about self medicating mental pain

637,ADHD,"My best friends unmedicated adhd kid was talking about dying by age 8. At age 9, on meds, he was doing amazing in school, maintaining friendships, enjoying his hobbies, boosted self confidence and thriving. He's more himself than he was before. He's happy, hyper, creative, funny, but he doesn't get stuck in his own head anymore. I took meds at 15 and didn't like how it made me feel- but instead of trying to adjust doses like I should have, I just stopped taking them. I have a lot of bitterness about how my life could've been different if I'd been on treatment that whole time instead of crashing out in my late 20s and getting diagnosed again as an adult and getting on effective medication. There's a really interesting study that came out recently showing that children with adhd taking adhd medication actually helps long term to heal some of the issues- they show fewer adhd symptoms in adulthood than other people who were not medicated. Unfortunately for us, the study is pretty new, so the normal timeline of about 10 years applies before it'll be the norm in practice.",1,1,children with adhd taking adhd medication actually helps long term,they show fewer adhd symptoms in adulthood

642,OpiatesRecovery,"My initial comment makes it sound like you should just accept what she going through, so I want to add that chronic pain or not, there are ways to manage opiate use that minimizes side effects. For the record, I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice. If she's running out periodically, then she's not always taking it as prescribed. If she would be willing to give up some control, and that's a big IF, then it might be helpful if someone else was involved with managing her doses. Not to take it away from her, but just to supervise so she can't sneak doses in secret. Then maybe she could avoid periods of withdrawal and live a more stable life. Also when it comes to therapeutic opiate use, less is more. Increasing the dose, which many doctors are happy to do in the beginning, has a less than proportiante decrease in pain. There are cases where she could double her dose, and after a week her tolerance would adjust to a degree that there's little to no decrease in pain. Doubling the dose does increase dependence and side effects though. If I were in her shoes, I'd try to get to the lowest dose of oxy possible while still having some effect, and supplement it with low dose OTC pain meds on a rotating schedule, so like aspirin one day, ibuprofen the next day, naproxen after that, etc. From your description she sounds depressed. One of the side effects of opiate addiction is that it will steal all the joy from your life. Your body stops producing it's own feel good chemicals, and you become dependent on it to not feel completely hopeless and empty. If she can get to a lower dose or get off it, then some or all of the capicity to feel real joy and happiness from doing normal things will come back, but the only way to get there is to go through a period of deep depression where you feel completely hopeless and hate yourself in spite of how good things might seem from the outside. Withdrawal isn't just physical - the emotional component is brutal. Be patient and compassionate, because anything she does to improve her situation is going to require deep extended suffering and it's incredibly hard and confusing to deal with, because it really feels like you'll never be happy again. If you have questions I'm always happy to talk.",1,1,"Increasing the dose, which many doctors are happy to do in the beginning, has a less than proportiante decrease in pain",One of the side effects of opiate addiction is that it will steal all the joy from your life

657,AskDocs,"NAD - I'm clinically high risk for breast cancer so I have a bit more info than the average person imo. It's a common misconception that birth control/hormones cause cancer. I think it's because it once was sort of proven in clinical trials at one point, but has since been disproven. For the longest time, docs would have women get off birth control at age 35 to reduce cancer risk. They don't do this anymore. So that's all to say, I really don't think you need to worry about an increased risk for cancer. However, I suggest you still try to reduce your risk by avoiding things that have been solidly proven to reduce your risk. Don't smoke and don't drink. Get your heart rate up for awhile a few times a week. Eat stuff that gives you sustained energy/makes you feel good. Worrying about cancer does nothing for you. Except maybe increase your cortisol levels which is no bueno. Just focus on your health moving forward. Cancer research has come so far and survival rates keep climbing. The treatments have become less intense too. Or at least, symptoms are more treatable. The way I understand plan B is that it basically blasts you with a bunch of hormones (like a months worth of birth control?? Idk, fact check that one) so it throws your body out of wack. I imagine you've had a lot of mood swings, lots of cravings and just generally feeling unstable. Finally, if you ever find yourself without health insurance again, there are so many options for affordable care. First, planned parenthood.

659,AskDocs,"NAD I have had two SJS reactions in my life, one evolved into TENS. The one that evolved into TENS was on the heels of taking Bactrim for a sinus infection, the more minor reaction was from Cipro. I cannot take Sulfa drugs. We haven't tried any additional sulfas just because no thank you. I can, however, take Augmentin, Doxycycline, and a few others. Essentially, unless it's a drug like Lamotrigine where it's like ""this will very likely push you into an SJS reaction"" we just accept that any medication I take has the potential to do it. Heck, even acetaminophen can do it one day, as I understand it. I feel like I'm lucky in the fact that my two reactions started very similarly, so when the second one hit, I went **oh god** and booked it to the ER. I do have rough anxiety when weird crap pops up though. For instance, I was at a baseball practice for my son a few days ago. I put SPF all over every morning like clockwork. This practice was later in the day and it was overcast. I spent the majority of the practice with my right leg crossed over my left. Later that evening, I started feeling a burning sensation on the side of my knee and down my shin, and on my left leg on the top a bit. I immediately started to freak out because my immediate thought was OH GOD HERE IT GOES AGAIN until my partner politely reminded me of how I was sitting at the practice, and asked if it could possibly be sunburn. It was sunburn. 100%. But the fear was very real and was there in spades, even though I've been on the same medications for years for my various health issues.

Called 911. They came to my house and after assessing me, told me I was just high lol. They also explained to me that sometimes your stomach can act up so bad it can make you feel like you are having a heart attack when it's not a heart issue at all. Basically just tried to reassure me I was just high and I'd be fine. Well, they left and my heart rate got up to 185 again and within 15 minutes, I had to call ambulance #2. Those paramedics were pissed that the first paramedics didn't take me in. They brought me to the hospital and basically made me sit there and wait til the high was over. I was so embarrassed. That was when I realized it was time to quit the weed for a bit. Unfortunately that wasn't the last time I ended up in the ER because of weed. The second time, I was back to taking pretty high doses. One day I woke up, took my oil tincture and then started to feel fluish. Next thing I know, my heart rate jumped through the roof, I was sweating, crazy palpations I had never experienced, shaky, arm pain and chest pain and then last but not least, sudden severe vomiting. At the time, I thought maybe I just had a flu and was just a bit anxious from the weed. To help with the nausea though, I continued to take it thinking it would at least help with that. Instead I just got sicker. Couldn't keep even sips of water down. Back to emergency I wentвЂ¦ Turns out I had ""Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome"" which happens when you have cycles of nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain after using cannabis for a long time. So had to quit again. 0/10 do not recommend lol. Basically, I'm no doctor but it sounds like your body is reacting poorly to THC and instead of making you chill and stoned, it's causing you severe anxiety. You said you took higher than normal doses so that could be why but sometimes our bodies just decide enough is enough and POOF weed is no longer fun. My advice is maybe take a tolerance break to start. If you don't feel like doing that, I'd suggest cutting down your usage and dose. Also strain is really important. If you are an anxious person, I'd stay clear of the sativa for now. I know it can help with anxiety but I also know sativa can make my anxiety go through the roof to the point I don't feel stoned I just feel like I'm having a heart attack and it's the worst feeling ever.

Also purging while medicating can cause you to get more or less of medication than needed, especially in any extended release forms.

You can also try orajel which is a topical form of benzocaine available over the counter at most drug stores or supermarkets. You may also try gargling/mouth rinses with warm but not hot salt water. If you just started the antibiotics it takes some time for them to start working, but once they do you may experience some relief of your pain from that too.

678,AskDocs,"NAD, but I'm a 39f and now 2.5 years sober after 20 years of alcoholism. The doc is right, it is very hard AND you can do it. If you tell yourself you can't, you will find it even harder. There are blood tests to check your liver enzyme levels, cholesterol, blood sugar, which can all be indicators of how much damage. I had some BAD numbers when I entered rehab, but now everything is at a normal level. Recovery and healing *are* possible. I've also lost 140 lbs! I used to binge eat total shit while drinking. There are drugs that can help, Natrexone is a great option for reducing cravings. Medication Assisted Detox aka MAD is extremely beneficial, if not required, for getting sober. Let me be very clear - quitting alcohol cold turkey can KILL you. Lots of drugs make you wish you were dead while you detox, but alcohol is one of the few where you can literally die. Do NOT try to stop without consulting a doctor. I met lots of people who seemed to be what you'd call ""a functional alcoholic"" who had jobs, kids, weren't getting arrested all the time - and they had terrible seizures while trying to quit alone. Personally, I tried to quit so many times, and failed over and over because I half assed it. AA never worked for me. I decided I was going to finally try with everything I had - I told my family and friends I needed help, they all rallied around me to help however they could, like calling my insurance to help check coverage and calling different rehab programs. I took FMLA from work, went to residential rehab for 35 days, and then did outpatient treatment for 3 months while slowly stepping down care. I'm happy to answer any questions you have, feel free to ask here or DM me. I'm very active in the recovery community, and have actually just applied to grad school to work in addiction recovery. Asking for help is what changed my whole life.",1,1,Medication Assisted Detox aka MAD is extremely beneficial,-1

Another possibility could be an allergic reaction to something - food, medication, soap/lotion/laundry detergent, etc. It would be very difficult to determine the exact cause without a thorough review of your history. I'd suggest an OTC antihistamine like Benadryl as well as hydrocortisone ointment to relieve the itchiness. However, if it continues to spread/gets worse, or if you develop other symptoms - especially fever, vomiting/diarrhea, chest tightness/difficulty breathing, swelling, or dizziness - I'd *strongly* advise going into urgent care immediately.",1,1,"these look like hives, which can certainly occur due to stress. ...

681,AskDocs,"NAD, if you are in severe pain like that then it would not be unreasonable to go to the ER, since there's a few medical emergencies that could present similarly to severe period cramps, like appendicitis or a ruptured ovarian cyst. If the pain is controlled now then there probably isn't a reason to go this time since it probably is just period cramps, but if something like this happens in the future and you aren't able to control it with OTC pain meds then you would not be overreacting if you went to the ER. Additionally, period cramps this severe are generally not normal. I'd recommend going to a gynecologist and describing your symptoms to them, because they may be able to prescribe you birth control to better control your menstrual cycles and/or check you for some conditions that can cause severe period cramps, like endometriosis or PCOS. I had heavy periods caused by both PCOS and a platelet disorder, so my gyno prescribed me birth control that I take without a break (apparently this is something you can do without any long term consequences) so I don't get periods, and it improved my quality of life significantly.",1,1,period cramps this severe are generally not normal,-1

When I go outside everything is much brighter and larger, when I am in the house colors are more dull and I find it harder to see certain things including the pink in meat when I cook, etc., You may want to be tested for influenza, covid, and bronchitis. Bronchitis was the explanation for my chest symptoms. While I no longer have any symptoms, I did not fully recover until last month. I had dizzy spells, panick attacks, and disassociated and/or would stand up and everything would go black like I was about to black out. Turns out I need more iron and water. I currently also have an ear infection. I went in around 2-3 weeks ago and the doctor diagnosed me with an ear infection. I was given 5 days worth of medications to clear it and clear it did, but 3 days later it was back. I had it for almost two weeks before I could go back to Medexpress. The doctor (same dude as last time (I went yesterday)) explained he may have underdiagnosed/undertreated me and prescribed me a different antibiotic I must take for 10 days. He says if I return for a 3rd time I'll be visiting the ENT. A friend of mine recommended Xlear which helps reduce ear infections by 90% and helps break down the biofilm. I also found allergy meds will clear any water eyes. Sorry this may be a bit much to read, but you will make it. I know you feel yucky right now, but if I can do it you can. Be sure to check with a doctor and ask what you can use alongside antibiotics. Please remember there is no home remedy that will work 100%! You need to see a doctor for an ear infection. Some suggestions to ask your doctor about are what I previously mentioned and another is hydrogen peroxide. You put a single drop in and let it sit while you lay on your side, when you're done you can flip over and hold a cotton ball to it. This will help remove was build-up.

If y'all plan on having sex on a regular basis it might be a good idea to look into hormonal birth control. She can get it from her primary doctor if she has insurance and if not theirs now an over the counter hormonal birth control called the o-pill And because you did have unprotected sex she should test this cycle, around the time she would get her next period (it might be a good idea to test even if she does get her next period because implantation spotting can imitate a period for some people) because the sooner you know the more options you have.

696,AskDocs,"NAD. Many of the very negative replies and downvotes here come from the fact that it is common, even in the medical profession, to be under informed about chronic pain. It's unfortunate, but it's a fact of life for those of us suffering with it. Things are improving in that regard though! You may want to specify in your post that you take higher than normal doses of OTC painkillers under the guidance of a physician. That said, as another ankylosing spondylitis patient, my hope is that when you see your new rheumatologist, you'll be able to access the gold standard for treatment--a biologic medication. As far as painkillers go, when you take one, set a timer or alarm on your phone for several hours. When it goes off, if you need relief again, *take the other medication.* Swapping back and forth gives you coverage without the risk of overdoing it on one substance. I would want a professional to chime in with timing they'd suggest for that tactic. I will also say, NSAIDs like ibuprofen/advil are better for arthritis like ours and generally more forgiving. Unlike tylenol, NSAIDs reduce inflammation which can really help with the stiffness. Liver damage is less likely than with acetaminophen/tylenol, but it's very important to take with food and stay hydrated to protect your stomach lining and kidneys. Every drug has drawbacks. I don't mean to treat you like a little kid, you know to drink water, but hey, I have ADHD too and we all need reminders not to kill our kidneys.

You aren't a piece of shit at all, but you are very likely someone who has been self-medicating something else because you don't have the right support. Something else to think about it too... Drugs like diazepam and zopiclone are depressants that sedate you. They reduce anxiety and calm you down, but also make you tired.

712,Anxiety,"No need to be scared to take it. It doesn't mess with your head like some anxiety medications, more like it calms down your body's response to stress, so it's not the best first med to take for anxiety and may not address it much for some people, but you have to try it and see. However when I am being cautious about a new med, I will first take only half the prescribed dose, wait about 3 hrs before taking the rest and not take it if there are undesirable side effects already at the 1/2 dose level, but when I first did that with propranolol, after a couple hours I was like ""I don't feel much of anything, I'll take the other half"", then another hour or two later, I did notice a positive change. At most you might feel a bit sluggish with a lower than usual heart rate till you get used to it, but unless your heart rate was too low to begin with, this shouldn't be a problem on that dose and if the side effects are too much, contact your doctor. I am only generalizing since I don't know your medical condition nor what other medications you might be taking. If you have triggered episodes of anxiety, then the fast acting may be more what you need as the ER can take 2+ hours to feel much effect. The ER is a capsule with around 100 tiny beads in it, so I pull the capsule apart, dump approximately half the beads in a cup to take it, then put the capsule back together with the remaining 1/2 dose in it still to take later. It's annoying to do that but only takes a dozen seconds if your fingers are clean so they grip the capsule well to pull it apart. I should also mention that the manufacturer of mine is Lannett, and the capsules are very easy to pull apart, but I've had capsules of different meds, whether prescription or OTC, where the capsules were much more difficult to pull apart and it might not be practical to do so if they are very tight or even a band holding the two halves together. It's quite possible that not everyone needs to do this, but I seem to metabolize away some medications faster than other people. I would try taking the whole dose as prescribed and see for yourself if that works okay before deviating from exactly what your Dr. directed, and talk with that Dr. when making changes. Another thing I should mention is that a lot of the reason I take it is difficultly sleeping at night and being woken in the morning by loud noise, so this is why I take half at night and if I were to take it only once a day, for that reason it would be at night, since the ER takes a couple hours to notice the effect for me. Since it does lower your heart rate more than not taking it, if you have been self medicating with a depressant, even alcohol, I would reduce the amount of that if not abstain for a while to see how you're doing. I take a blood pressure reading at least daily and this also shows my heart rate. I am not a doctor so above all that I wrote, communicate with your doctor early on if you have negative side effects.",1,1,"Since it does lower your heart rate more than not taking it, if you have been self medicating with a depressant, even alcohol, I would reduce the amount of that if not abstain for a while to see how you're doing",-1

As I understand, senna is strong laxative, it stimulates your intestines. After a while, I am guessing that your body gets used to an ""outside force"" doing this, so your body's ability to do so naturally either weakens or stops causing even more BM issues.

You risk losing a lot of water and electrolytes. Your body needs water and electrolytes. OP, I think it would be a better idea to address your mental health with a psychiatrist and therapy.

At 14, I developed an eating disorder. I lied to doctors. Bad people smell trauma like sharks smell blood in the water. At 16, I was raped by someone I loved and trusted. I was so used to handling things on my own that I didn't anybody. My late teens and early 20s were a blur of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, Vicodin, abusive relationships, and promiscuity. I lied to doctors. I got good at cramming all the bad feelings and memories into little boxes in my mind. White noise took the place of my emotions. I was numb. New bad things would happen or ugly memories would resurface, and they would get crammed into their own boxes. I lied to doctors. Then a few years ago, I went through a big traumatic event that broke open all those boxes at once. All the bad came back at the same time. I was unprepared. I was drowning. I stopped lying to doctors. One of the doctors I told changed my life. I'm 38 years old and only recently realized how connected all the bad things were. I lied to doctors because deep down I knew I wasn't actually ok and something really was wrong (otherwise why would I have lied?). I was way too young to carry all that hurt and responsibility.

735,medical,"Not a licensed healthcare professional, but I did complete my PharmD, and I work in drug development in the inflammation/oncology space. I think assessing the cause of the inflammation in parallel to its treatment would be your best long term strategy. Unless autoimmune related, inflammation is buy and large a stress response to exogenous factors like environment, diet, infection, injury, and lifestyle. Without having details it's hard to make a great recommendation, but Ill share what I know to try and help OP: Prescription-wise there are many options available depending on the nature, location, frequency of inflammation and/or pain. Consulting with an area-specific specialist where the inflammation/pain is affecting you would be the best avenue. There are many companies who make injectable biologics that target inflammation, but these therapies are often highly precise to a specific disease state/protein target, require prescription, and can be pretty expensive if your insurance company has decided you didn't try enough other options long enough. Each have their own potential side effects, and I personally would start with a more holistic approach first. Assessing dietary allergies: some folks have unknown food allergies that can contribute to chronic inflammation. There are resources online for different diets which can help isolate specific food groups that contribute to inflammation. If you have the resources, a dietitian could helpвЂ¦ but the internet has a lot of this info and is free. OTC Oral NSAIDs (naproxen/ibuprofen) aren't the best for chronic use especially when you have concurrent GI issues. As others have mentioned, you run the risk of peptic ulcers and GI bleed after long term use via damage to the mucosal lining of the stomach. If you are struggling with joint/muscle/or osteo pain, topical NSAIDs can be effective. Diclofenac (Voltaren) is an OTC topical used typically for joint pain. During my rotations in ambulatory care/community pharmacy, I encountered many patients who swore by it. No GI risk, minimal side effects and can be applied as needed. Some other options are capsaicin, tiger balm, biofreeze if the pain relates to the joints/muscles. Outside of that, CBD helps a lot of people with chronic pain/inflammation and comes in a variety of formulations for topical and systemic use. It's non-psychoactive and widely available online and at pharmacies. The risk is relatively low, and side effects are fairly minimal. This can be hit and miss, since you mentioned you develop tolerance quite quickly. If you haven't tried it, might be worth a shot? hopefully this helps a bit and you feel better!",1,1,"OTC Oral NSAIDs (naproxen/ibuprofen) aren't the best for chronic use especially when you have concurrent GI issues. ...

737,Drugs,"Not quite as young as you, but I had drank 2 5Oz Delsym bottles when I was 12 years old. It was incredibly strange and impossible to describe. From what I can remember, I felt nothing, had no idea what anything was and traveled through many different dimensions and cartoon dreamscapes, I slipped in and out of consciousness many times. My parents had to take me to the ER, which I remember none of, I was conscious for about 10% of the experience. But during the parts of awareness, I did also have that extremely intense sense of confusion and almost an impending doom/fear. The best way I could describe it, is being so close to starting your thought, knowing exactly what you have to do to ""start the thought"", but desperately trying to grasp onto the first word of the thought, yet it keeps slipping away and you are just stuck in boundless and wordless confusion. This experience sort of ""indoctrinated"" me. At the time, I knew what drugs were and was super angry for some reason I can't even remember, and I wanted to be happy. I knew that drugs were terrible, but they made people happy, so I searched up something like ""how to get drugs at home"", thinking it would be as easy as ordering something online, and low and behold I found that otc cough medicine could get you high. After no further research, I gauged that 2 bottles would be enough and took them. My parents had strictly warned me against drugs all my life and my parents never even smoke or drank. I don't know why I went against everything I knew in an instant, but I did, and was absolutely not expecting what was about to happen. Following the experience, knowing almost nothing about drugs, I thought reality had quite literally just broken apart. I wholeheartedly believed that the cough medicine I just drank, had revealed some alien dimension and supernatural level of existence. It took probably around 1-2 years that I realized drugs don't actually transport you to other dimensions, but after the initial experience, all bets were basically off. I researched more and more about DXM and other drugs, watching videos all day, basically becoming obsessed. I took any chance I could to get cough medicine, lying, using my parents credit cards and accounts, even stealing from stores, I just HAD to be in that dimension. This pattern of huge and sporadic binges continued until early middle school, when I ""branched out"" and started using marijuana and other drugs. This is when my parents inevitably found out the cough medicine wasn't a one time thing. And previous to this, I was quite literally the perfect kid, so my parents were pretty devastated. Anyways that was my experience, but I definitely think drugs at a young age, hijack the brain way way worse. I remember it was like a complete 180 in my mind. All my goals, aspirations, even my own family, were all instantly replaced after I saw what that bottle of delsym could do. I was always risk averse and followed rules as a young kid, and I had never even gotten in trouble at school before then. But within a week of the trip, I was sneaking out of my house, stealing from stores, things I had only seen in movies. I would steal from my parents without a second though, becoming so obsessed with DXM, that I would almost forget about my parents. At times, I would have almost 0 emotional attachment to them, just viewing them as obstacles in the way of visiting the special universe. It was a very dark time in my life, and my entire identity was centered around drugs, every decision was made in part of some larger attempt to get DXM, it hooked me like crack. I am diagnosed with BPD, ASD, and ADHD, which could have played a part into the way things played out, but I still think I would have handled drugs FAR better had I not been so young when I started using.

The staffing pharmacist and one (or, if we were lucky, two) technician would come in half an hour before the pharmacy opened in order to fill the queue of refill requests that piled up overnight. As a technician, I had a handheld scanner that I would use to scan the script then the drug and I'd count out the appropriate amount, then bottle and label. Everything goes into a basket and set on the counter for the pharmacist to check. Uninterrupted like this, we could get through maybe 60-100 scripts, depending on the pharmacist and the technician (not to gloat, but I was the fastest and most accurate technician in our store's district, according to the metrics I still loathe). Then we'd open properly and the other technician and the cashier would come in. The cashier strictly pulled the finished dispenses and rang out patients. The other technician worked the dropoff window where patients would bring hard copy scripts and where we resolved any insurance discrepancies/denials, triaged phone calls, etc. This would continue for a few hours (without breaks) until the second pharmacist came in. The first pharmacist would then go to lunch while the second took over checking. There would be a brief period, usually an hour or so, where we had two pharmacists checking, which would (hopefully) get us caught up. Then the second pharmacist would take their lunch and when they came back, it was time for the first pharmacist to leave. By this point we'd usually done something like two-thirds of our fills for the day. Because we were doing so many scripts in such a short amount of time, that leaves literally no room for the pharmacist to do such things as verify controlled substances, counsel patients (most refused it anyway, but we were required to offer it), or advise on OTC products. All the pharmacists were able to do was check fills the technicians queued up for them. As a tech, I handled all the insurance rejections, copay questions, phone calls for refills that could have been put on through the automated system, patients coming up the window requesting a refill on a medication they don't know the name of, don't know what they're taking it for, and only vaguely know what it looks like, etc. All while dodging insults and threats (and more often than you might think, objects) hurled at me for a patient's medication not being ready when they wanted it to be. All for $2 USD over minimum wage. Usually after 17:00 things would slow down, so we could (again) catch up on the backlogged queue of new/refill scripts and start on EOD procedures like filing hard copy scripts and placing the order. Staff would stay for half an hour or so after closing to finish out whatever we could, knowing it would never be enough and we're still going to get bitched at by corporate for not pushing immunizations hard enough or some shit.

767,Anxiety,"One of the dangers of refusing proper medication is that people sometimes look for other substances to get relief, for example alcohol, weed, etc. I can't speak about weed because I never tried it, but I did self-medicate with alcohol. That was one of the most foolish things I've done that made everything much worse and it took a lot of effort to get out of that hole (and the anxiety was still there). I think much depends on your type of anxiety and how well you can function. Anxiety is very treatable without medication, but if your anxiety is so severe that it cripples your life so much that you can't function anymore, and thus can't actually work on getting better, then medication can give you the break you need to regain control over your life and work on your anxiety in a constructive way. Differently put: if you're working on getting better and you make progress, then medication isn't a priority for you. If you sit or lay around and your life is falling apart while you're overwhelmed and do nothing, then it can work well together with therapy. Also, not all anxiety medication is the same. I'd not recommend taking a benzodiazepine regularly (the risk of addiction is just too big and benzo withdrawal is one of the worst withdrawals to go through, and it can be fatal), but there are various antidepressants and other medication for anxiety that aren't highly addictive.",1,1,I did self-medicate with alcohol.

774,pharmacy,"Or the social media platforms that promote only the view of a ""perfect"" life don't allow children without the forethought to analyze a situation with more critical thinking skills that lives shared on social media are only one aspect. They don't share the normal, the mundane, the negative. They fabricate a more than perfect life that for most is unachievable. That's why as people get older and their critical thinking develops they care less. Also not to mention the dire economic outcomes for young people these days. You can no longer just expect to purchase a house off a single person income. You can't even guarantee that the social programs you need to survive most of the time will be continued; your workers regulations were cut, and now youre getting even less PTO. It doesn't take a brain worm to realize that depression and anxiety are due to extraneous factors most of the time. And even when it's an extraneous concern, these medications are PROVEN to help. Also imagine grouping mood stabilizers in this category. So anyone with epilepsy, other seizure conditions (benzos included in this one too; including alcohol abuse related seizures), bipolar?

Honestly whatever school you went to should be shut down if you can't really use critical thinking to suggest that these medications are necessary. Part of their psychological response??? That's WHAT the meds are there to do. To curb THAT RESPONSE. Before I was given Adderall, I had therapy, I had doctors appointments, I had CBT, it helps minutely. That *paired* with stimulant treatment helped me. Whether you like it or not, these conditions are real. Tightening them up will lead to one thing, more suicides. Also, who is glorifying being depressed. Are you that dense? Do you not think that maybeвЂ¦. Just, maybeвЂ¦. That nothings really significantly changed? Maybe the awareness as grown and people aren't afraid of being called crazy, nuts, lazy, among other names? Maybe they're asking for help?

We can't even use our brains to suggest hey, maybe the hormones ravaging their bodies are to blame. Maybe we need to let em know it's okay and things will be okay more.

776,OpiatesRecovery,"Oregon is the worst. It's where I'm currently at (long story but this should be a temporary stay at most, but I did grow up here unfortunately, came back after 14 years away and living on east coast). I am alone and the gloomy rainy gray weather is something I am not mentally or emotionally equipped to deal with. That's why I end up self medicating as nothing else seems to have worked as far as therapy goes and this crippling emptiness I feel every day since I was just a young child). I know it's not the answer and self medicating with opiates is a doomed solution, but sometimes it feels like the only way for me to want to live is with them. Even before I spiraled out of control with them (when Covid started and I just lost all my social interactions and normal work schedule that kept me somewhat stable or at least not hyper focused on feeling empty), I have always felt something gigantic is missing in me. I never felt any sort of passion towards any hobby or activity or just anything that other people enjoy and get excited for. Nothing outside of super risky behavior ever got me any sort of feeling of liveliness and even those risky adrenaline rushing things or situations I sometimes got myself in, would barely be enough and made everything feel even worse the next day (if that was even possible). Either way I was doing dumb early 20's things that were sort of fun, alcohol filled weekends etc etc but that phase had ended and I have no desire to drink or go clubbing these days. The only substance I've ever loved and stupidly worshipped (and still do I guess, from the way i talk and romanticize it) is opiates. I have this strong feeling that I was a junkie in past lives as well, and I don't even think I believe in that reincarnation stuff. It's weird I know. What you wrote really resonated with me because I feel like I can't keep up with life and life responsibilities without them and every time I get clean I feel so fucking guilty for not being able to be a functional person instead of some depressed shell of a human, which makes me relapse and keeps the vicious cycle going. It feels like I can't really focus on getting well and focus on recovery because life keeps being thrown at me and it's either I do what I need to do to keep up with life or I drop everything and focus on recovery but who knows how long that will take and I'm in no position to take all that time off currently. I have never hit any sort of real rock bottom fortunately because I have an incredible support system as far as financial help goes and I know that I have a safety net to catch me if I get in real trouble, but I also have been able to somewhat keep up with life responsibilities while going back and forth between clean time and relapsing this past year and I have no real idea how to break free from the cycle because I have never lived a mentally healthy life. And now that all hell has broke loose, and I am self medicating which has been the only way I feel stable and clear enough in the head and not wishing to die, I'm just sorta here and floating, not dead, but not really alive either. Somewhere in between. And people around me don't know for the most part. It's my dirty shameful little secret and I don't know how to explain to them that something is very very broken inside my brain and I question any sort of meaning in life every second of every minute every day. When I'm using though, that cloud of pointlessness and meaningless goes away and I can get myself to just do things just because I know I'm expected to do them as an adult living modern society. But this is a bandaid solution and I have been bleeding out of it for too long, the bandaid is no longer stopping the massive amount of blood gushing out and I know that if I don't do something drastic and put something in place to replace this bandaid quick fix, I will bleed out and to death.

It took 15 years for the FDA to approve Prozac. It initially failed FDA approval in the mid 80s. But the maker Eli Lilly had already spent hundreds of millions on the research...they would not take no for an answer. They sweet talked certain people they knew at the FDA into including data that was not included before. And guess what other drug was in the data. Benzodiazepines. When they pooled the data together, Prozac passed FDA approval. But remember that was for TWO drugs not one. And they hardly prescribe benzos now so the approval was skewed...later studies found SSRI's are only 20% more effective than a placebo sugar pill. It's the benzo with it that put it over the top for approval. Your doctor doesn't know this...but now you do.",1,1,SSRI's are such bullshit. Yes they can help but they hurt in other ways,-1
814,medicine,"SSRIs and SNRIs also have a weird side effect where they can cause urinary incontinence. I didn't know this. So whenever I've been put on them, I start wetting the bed and have had....incidents. The last time I was trying to street park a rental car. But I got out of the car, realized dear god I really have to pee. And i need to take photos of the car to cover my ass, return the car keys, and get home to a bathroom. So, I cleverly sat down on the side walk and just peed. I would've been ashamed, but I've proudly come past that. And the SSRIs/ NRIs always make me want to kill myself in weird ways. In 2013 I decided I'd either hang myself or jump off this really pretty gazebo near the philly art museum. Now the museum is sort of verboten, my little brother killed himself on march 9 2019 and it was near 17th and green, so I never want to go anywhere near there. But the antidepressents make me wanna slit my wrists, or drive a car into a wall, or drowning myself. So, that's unsettling and it's like...not my own thought. Thanks man, feels really good to have someone agree with me. Most of the time I feel like a fucking crazy person to be terrified of doctors, have trouble speaking because of anxiety. I dunno, I assume my parents don't want me--when I was a kid, I'd check to make sure their laptop bag was at home, and they had to come back for that, so maybe they'd take me too--I'm afraid of getting up in lecture halls or restaurants or movie theaters because of people looking at me, I don't remember my mom before 2000, but she must have been around because she's always worked from home. Couldn't tell you where I slept as a kid or describe my bedroom, no idea how we ate dinner or what we ate. I see a CRNP by zoom every 6 weeks--she said I was off on feb 22. So she ordered a fucking drug test. My cat, had her since 2014 just died, she'd been living with my mom since my brother died. I've lost 10 lbs in less than a month, my brother's dying again soon--that's how it feels. My dad is gone, I don't even know where he lives. My mom hasn't responded to a text from me in like a week. I'm taking a few bumps of coke a day and Oxy. So in theory I could pass, but I'm also taking valium. And if I fail, I'll never get medical help again, every doctor will just see that I failed a drug test and I'll never get treatment except for maybe an opioid use disorder. I want to break up with her anyway. She's got me on lamictal and once a doctor sees that they just assume I'm a fat bipolar poor little rich girl. But I hope the doctors are nicer once I'm thinner. And I'm lucky enough that she prescribed Klonopin...but that doesn't help with random onset panic, it's helped calm me down generally. But like, after a bad call with my mom, I'm almost catatonic for 48 hours. I just cry, stare into space, remind myself I'm scum, and listen to asuka screaming on loop. I do have drug problems, they didn't start until 2013 when I found out my little brother had been raped by a tutor in 2009. My brother gave me coke for the first time and told me it was crushed up ritalin at the end of 2014. And he gave me an oxy for the first time in 2016. We medicated ourselves and took care of each other, we didn't have anyone else, he was my only real family. My support system is just my poor fiancГ©, who had way too much on his shoulders. My dad said in 2017 that he'd leave in 5 years, so my brother and I just thought we had to do anything to survive. Since 2013 we hadn't lived more than a few blocks apart, or next door, or in the same building. My brother had some bad phases dealing with the rape where he got physical with me and my mom, we had to get a restraining order against him. He broke down my door once because he'd cut himself so deeply that like...I could see yellow inside, I think I was seeing fat. Never seen anything like it. We went to dad and he had already taken his sleeping meds and tried to close it up with hello kitty bandages. My brother went to the ER later. After he died, I tried doctors. I have a CRNP who prescribed me klonopin after I sent her an email of a family convo--my brother had run away and was with a sympathetic teacher, my dad said Lu must give great head--knowing about the rape, and my brother went back to the apartment he and my mom were living in (they were living in florida while my brother was in high school, eleventh grade, he dropped out in 12th, ran away to florida that january and shot himself in the hand in a botched suicide. He was staying with his florida girlfriends family and they kept a .45 taped to the headboard). So, my dad coerced me into splitting time between philly and new york. He said no one would hire me with an english degree and my brother needed me and our family business to work. My dad insisted on taking the rapist to trial, and we won, but it was really bad for my brother. My dad made my brother stop therapy because it was taking too much time. I stopped because the message I got was, it's my fault for not communicating with my mom better and reaching out to my dad. And Dad started to hate talking to me because I talk to much and I was getting fat at the end of 2015. The last time we talked was the day my brother died, he said he was sorry and that it would effect me longer than him--since he'd die sooner than me. Which isn't fair at all. He couldn't stand the fatness though, one time he weighed me every A few days later he told my mom that he could still have a new family, he could have new kids, but she couldn't....less than a week after her son died. But he finally acknowledged it was his fault and that he's just toxic. Due to family insanity, I'm stuck in philly, like a mile from where my brother died, and if I give up and move somewhere--NYC is the only place i'd wanna go, I went to college there and that's where all my friends live. But it's crazy expensive and my parents would cut off all financial support--and I'd loose the only opportunity I have left in philly. I grew up in philly and know no one here, my old best friend from middle school is terrified of my father--it's a trend. My dad used to get drunk and talk to bartenders and patrons and anyone who'd listen how I'm a whore who fucked half of philly and about how my little brother was raped when he was 14. Probably because he gave shitty blow jobs so the guy had to nut somehow. The first doc saw a self harm scar--I burn myself, it's bad enough that I pretty much ruined my forearms, I can't show them in public and I'm really sensitive about my upper arms after my dad said they were disturbing at my size. He's got a thing about my weight. Seeing me over 150 lbs (bmi 25) triggers him. But dad called. Said I'd upset mom and would need to spend the summer making it up to her. He'd take me on, but no more 'drama.' So, right out of domestic abuse playbook. If I went on my own, he wouldn't just cut me off financially, he made it clear that I couldn't speak to my brother or my mom again. Oh, and my brother's death-a-versey is on march 9th. Why would I be out of it? And, you know, I want to kill myself everyday, but I can't tell her that. What can she do? Suggest some horrible inpatient place and have to take another SSRI. Be told its my fault my parents don't support me, because I communicate terribly and let them bother me. My mom said I was disturbed for still having trouble deciding what to do or how to live without my brother. I live like 6 blocks from where my brother and I grew up. But I can't give up on the business opportunity, and again, where else would I go? We tried living in the suburbs in 2022 and that didn't work at all. I've been doing a little coke and taking oxy. I'm not sure if I should end the relationship with the CRNP, I can buy benzos online, she won't prescribe anything for panic attacks and she has me on lamictal. So Doctor's see that and the scars and just assume I'm a bipolar poor little rich girl. And my mom said nothing bad ever really happened to me, so if I tried going to group therapy no one would have any sympathy for me--she said it'd be a good reality check. Maybe she's right. So I don't talk about any of that stuff because she's right, I had every opportunity and instead I got fat and killed me brother. But that CRNP suggest I have complex PTSD and that fits everything way better than depression. Nothing is internal, it's all situational. I should have left, but I'm weak willed. I also started having a stress reaction where I have no appetite, forget to eat. I was 280 in august of 2022, 172 near Jan 26th and 161.8 on feb 22nd. And it's fine because I'm still fat, but you know, I'm out of it. CRNP didn't ask about more weight loss. I must have been stress eating to get so fat, but now I feel like my brother's dead because I chose food over him. After I got fat my dad stopped talking to me and my brother had to deal with him alone. And my brother got worse after that, ah so, any opinion on this drug test? I'd like to just tell her I'm gonna fail, I can't risk that on my record, and part ways. I dunno. I was going to leave anyway because I was so fucking offended that she pushed this like within 2 weeks of the day my brother died. She couldn't have waited a few weeks? And I want to see someone older with experience, this woman is my age and like...I know she's had some training, but I'm just telling her the same lie that things are improving and everything is okay. TLDR: take drug test, risk failing and ruining medical options for decades, or breakup with CRNP and just tell her I'm not taking it, any other meds, and I'm done. I can order everything online anyway. And thanks for the support , i really appreciate it--makes me not feel like a crazy who belongs on the streets. And I miss my dead rape brother and my family and I have problems.",1,1,SSRIs and SNRIs also have a weird side effect where they can cause urinary incontinence. ...

815,pharmacy,"SUMMARY ADHD and SUDs frequently co-occur, particularly in SUD treatment settings. The etiology of the increased association of ADHD and SUD is unknown, although one possible cause is that substance use represents an attempt to ""self-medicate"" ADHD symptoms. Untreated ADHD leads to significant consequences and may impair a patient's ability to benefit from SUD treatment. Pharmacotherapy remains the mainstay for the treatment of ADHD, and psychostimulants continue to be first-line treatments. Several non-stimulant medications have shown promise for the treatment of ADHD, but their role for patients with co-occurring SUDs has not yet been determined. While stimulant medications have the potential for abuse and must be used cautiously in patients with substance use disorders, the available evidence suggests that stimulant medications administered under monitored conditions can be safe and effective in patients with substance use disorders. However, ongoing substance use can limit the efficacy of stimulant pharmacotherapy, and there is an irreducible risk of misuse, abuse, and diversion of stimulant medications when used to treat ADHD comorbid with substance use disorders. A conservative approach for treating co-occurring ADHD and SUD would be to begin treatment with a non-stimulant pharmacotherapy, but if an adequate response is not obtained, consider stimulant pharmacotherapy. The decision regarding the use of stimulant medications for a patient with ADHD and a co-occurring substance use disorder should be made on the basis of a broad clinical assessment and an individual risk-benefit analysis. For many patients, psychostimulants can be used safely and effectively; however, careful monitoring during treatment is essential to ensure prescribed stimulants are being used in a therapeutic manner, and in the case of worsening substance use or when faced with evidence of the diversion of prescribed medication, treatment should be discontinued.",1,1,stimulant medications administered under monitored conditions can be safe and effective in patients with substance use disorders.,-1

819,OpiatesRecovery,"Same here. Nobody would ever believe me that I had lived this secret shameful addicted life the last few years. Especially because I have always been anti big pharma (NOT anti western medicine, huge difference) and shitting on them whenever I can, so to think I would actually use this shit to self-medicate even though I knew exactly where this always ends up Aka addiction train is probably something people around me would never believe about me. The truth is that I always knew I'm no better than anyone and the warm feeling it gave me was too tempting to NOT fall down the trap for me. Obviously I didn't really understand the implications of tolerance and how it will no longer actually give me that warmth and bubbly peaceful feeling after a very short period and I'd just be at normal levels functional, but somehow it still made it better for me when I knew I had my emotional crutch near by and could just crush up a pill and rail up some lines whenever I was irritated or frustrated or just bored out of my mind with the daily cycle of life (wake up, shower eat work, rinse repeat times x forever). Even when it stopped working and no matter how much I took I'd still be at very base level, just mentally having that small mirror and straw nearby made everything tolerable and just numbed me out to where I can just scroll aimlessly on my phone and watch hours of YouTube after work at nighttime and not feel this crushing black-bleak-dark cloud of depression over my head. Again the physical effect barely existed and I still felt so much better just having this stash of blueberries nearby to dose up on whenever I had too many feelings thoughts. It's a sad world we live in and a sad way to live but that's how I felt. This was prime peak Covid days when I fell in deep into an active addiction and there was really never a chance for me when those circumstances and daily life environment had trapped me in - it felt like either I'm gonna kill myself or self medicate. Now obviously today I know for a fact that this was a terrible way of thinking and clearly the ""die or get high"" mindset was just me unable to self-regulate my emotions and having zero coping mechanisms, but at the time I was so lost that looking back I don't think there's anything anyone could have said to me or taught me that would have diverted me from going down this path and letting it get out of control like I did. It feels like I had to fall down to get back up and climb out of the hole or more accurately - grave - that I dug myself. I think I've always had a small obsession with opiates and how they'd make me feel and the pandemic time was the perfect storm and perfect conditions for me to be trapped with it entirely. Up until then I would just happen to score a few here and there with a prescription or something minimal. I would never actively seek it out nor did I spend any time trying to get them - just whatever would come by me. But 2020 came around and all hell broke loose, outside in the world, and in my head, simultaneously. But I do believe this was a life lesson I had to personally learn in my own flesh and bones. Cautionary tales would not have helped me. I needed to experience the peak highs and the LOW lows for myself, in order to realize that opium is not the god pill that was missing in my life, but the devil making its way and taking its grip of my mind and soul. The reality is, that there are no shortcuts to feeling good, you have to actually work on your mental health and find ways to emotionally self-regulate if you want to live a decent life. I'm not really quite there, as far as my way to happiness - still working on figuring out how to best get a grip over my thoughts and my brain which seem to want to kill me, but I'm working hard as hell. But there's always more I can do to make myself happier, it's just so exhausting sometimes, especially when I look elsewhere, people all around me - and all of them or at least a good chunk of them seem to have it come so naturally and easily. It feels like everyone around me is just able to cruise through and enjoy things for what they are without having the mental torture of their brain constantly telling them something is wrong or missing or pointless or whatever negative pathway it could possibly take them on. I always wonder what it's like to be one of those people that can just function and feel okay about their every day. Even my family don't seem to have any mental issues anywhere close to what I suffer from. My siblings are actually happy, and my parents are too. And not just ""seem happy"" on social media. Like legit happy because I see them regularly and they are truly content at the end of every day. Not overthinking their purpose in the world or questioning meaning of life, just content with life and content with their day and content with their tomorrow. Me howeverвЂ¦..ooooooohhfffff.

One thing I noticed with trying to taper, I tried to jump to the next lower dose way too quickly, like every 3 days, which wasn't long enough for my body to adjust, then i'd go back up, so make sure you're leaving adequate time between lowered doses, and don't make the drops too big to manage. The biggest thing for me in sticking to it, was resolving the root cause. I have various mental health issues and none of the medication was working and I was self medicating, until I finally got my adhd diagnosis and the medication reduced the symptoms of all the other stuff I had, which led to me forgetting all about the codeine. So think about whether the medication for depression, anxiety and ocd are actually really helping you or not, then really push upon the GP for help with them, also consider asking to be referred to the community mental health team if you haven't been already, the gp can be fantastic at a lot of things, but their mental health training just isn't as in depth as a psychiatrist/psychologist, also, there's medications that the mental health team can prescribe which a gp can't/wont unless directed to do so by a psychiatrist. I also used an app called ""days since"" (on iphone but may be available for android, if not there will be something similar). It tracks times since things have been logged, I added options for Codeine, Paracetamol Ibuprofen, and hit reset counter each time I took any of the 3, the first 1-2 days I didn't change any doses or time between doses, it was just to get an idea of how many doses per day and time between them. From day 3, I started making changes, made sure there was the recommended 4 hours between each dose minimum, if it had been 3 hours 45 mins, I would make myself wait until it said the 4 hours. Then over time, I gradually increased the time between doses by 5-10 mins, until I was taking less and less doses per day. I also created a note on my phone, with which combination of tablets created which dose, which decreased as it went down the list, so that it was in small drop increments, and also meant I never needed to work out what my next drop was, I could simply open the note and look at which was next. I'm happy to add the list as another comment on here if you'd like or would find it helpful, I just didn't want to increase the length of the comment even further than it already is. Also, the fact you already managed to drop 200mg is progress, so that's a positive already and should be recognised as one.",1,1,"the medication reduced the symptoms of all the other stuff I had, which led to me forgetting all about the codeine",-1

836,Anxiety,"So, I never saw an actual psychologist. Lexapro was prescribed to me by a doctor, who I was seeing for constant muscle fasciculations (benign fasciculation syndrome as I've learned it to be called) The doctor (and he wasn't the only one) really thought it was all anxiety related and I really hoped it was too. Anyways, he prescribed lexapro to me, I don't remember the dose I took it for two weeks. The reason I stopped was because two weeks after taking it, is when I first developed a tremor in my left thumb. That scared the shit out of me, I was already dealing with constant muscle twitching so I just immedietly stopped it. Then over the next few years my tremor just got worse and worse and eventually I got diagnosed with ET. Now, I don't know if Lexapro triggered it or whatever, it could just be a coincidence, but considering lexapro didn't help with my muscle twitching i wish I never took it. For therapy, it was only just therapist, not psychologists. It was all online ones, I would do a vid call for a month or so before just quitting, didn't seem worth the money and I didn't really have the patience to keep looking for one I trusted. I certainty do have some problems with anxiety but the most effective thing for it for me, is to just do what I know I need to do. I don't need a therapist to tell me or try to convince me out of beliefs that trigger it. Years of letting responsibilities and things slip away, not taking care of myself the way I feel I should and lots of escapism with weed and alcohol are the things I need to stop to get my anxiety under control. I'm working on that now and will just continue to do that, a $80 an hour paid friend isn't going to change what I need to do to get my shit together.

838,OpiatesRecovery,"Sobriety is worth more than any amount of money. Whatever the cost it's worth it. Don't wait or don't go to treatment cus it'll cost you money. It's best to think of it as literally the greatest investment you can make on your life cus without sobriety you can't achieve anything. Imo it's so much easier mentally, emotionally, and physically to stop using while in detox. First since they'll try to keep you as physically comfortable as possible and depending on detox that could range from otc or prescription comfort meds, sometimes even stronger stuff like Ativan or ambien in the beginning stages of detox for people in really bad shape. The other patients in the later stages of detox can help bring you emotional and mental support. Plus just seeing others make it thru and start feeling better will bring you more confidence and hope than you probably imagine rn. Now I will warn some state funded detoxes can be a miss tho as they sometimes mix in people with severe mental health disorders. After detox Id highly recommend a 30 day residential program as well as it'll increase your chances at long term sobriety. They are rare but really id recommend one that's at least 90-120days as statistically that's when there's a significant jump in success. Plus that time you spend away from your real life will start to feel like a blessing as adults rarely ever get that much time away from responsibility to work on and improve themselves. Just gotta use that time wisely instead of dicking around like many patients at treatment do as they just use them as a means to temporarily have a roof and food. Staying away from those people in treatment is wise. Although you may not be covered yet there are treatment centers willing to take people in before they're covered as long as they know for sure the person has coverage coming. I went to several in GA my home state where this was regular practice. So I'd suggest starting to reach out and contact whichever detox/residential programs look like they interest you. You'd be surprised what some of them can do to get you into treatment without any out of pocket. Finally for any opiate addicts, I always recommend they either do a long term sub taper or get on maintenance for anywhere from 90 days minimum to a yr max. As it'll give your brain and body time to recover and rebuild your life while holding withdrawals and cravings at bay. Then when it's time to get off the subs to get on sublocade. I've yet to meet anyone (except for 1 guy but he stayed on subs for 5+yrs) who has experienced anything more than very mild to no withdrawal symptoms when getting off subs with sublocade. Statistically sub use do increase long term recovery rates to over 50%. Medicaid I don't believe covers sublocade but the cash price is always gonna be higher than any insurance plan that covers it so I always recommend getting insurance for it. Again no price is too much for sobriety. I tried quitting many times for yrs before I finally gave treatment a try. I held back for so long cus of the negativity I'd heard about most places and the negative stigma around it. However it ended up being a far far better experience than I ever could've imagined. Still had my bumps along the way between programs and even after my last one. However I truly believe if I hadn't gotten my experience at all the treatment centers I went over the course of 2 yrs then I wouldn't have been ever able to stay sober for longer than a few weeks. Now I got over a yr. Regardless of what you choose to do, I'm rooting for you. I wouldnt wish opiate withdrawals and addiction on even my enemies. I believe you can overcome this, and once you do, you must stay vigilant and never forget the pain and suffering you experienced and caused to others during active addiction. As arrogance and/or ignorance is at the root of every addicts relapse story.",1,1,Statistically sub use do increase long term recovery rates to over 50%.,Statistically sub use do increase long term recovery rates to over 50%

Anyway SSRI meds can be lifesavers so anxiety should not get in the way. The benzos I mentioned are an example of jusified fears - addiction risk etc. Or opioid pain meds. Or amphetamines for ADHD.

The choice faced by gender medicine as a whole is not 'to give GAC or not to give GAC', but 'provide them with what they want or let them get it on their own.' Self-medication with gender affirming hormones and body modifications is not unheard of today and was never unheard of at any particular point in the past, at least going back to Aristotle.

So once she was in bed I self medicated with alcohol because of the pain and cleaned the house. I broke down and sobbed a few times when the pain leaked through the dissociative barrier. But I got it done. Clean, safe, and more toddler proofed for my sanity. I also used alcohol and dissociating to install air-conditioners this week. I don't remember what day. I tore some muscles I think. It's hard to tell. There isn't a single spot on my body that doesn't hurt. All my joints are inflamed. My muscles are burning and I've been having severe spasms. I have zero appetite and haven't been eating or drinking water but still breastfeeding my toddler. I think I ate a little bit yesterday. Last night I spent 3 hours of cardio level cleaning. Moved furniture. Vacuumed. Mopped. Cleaned up a bug problem. Then took a shower. I started shaking and shivering uncontrollably with weird jerking of my hands. I was unable to walk. It was like a full body Charlie horse. It lasted 18 minutes. I tried to call my support people but nobody answered. I had Noone to come sleep with my baby so I could go to the ER. Once the spasm finally stopped I took magnesium and cbd and tried to sleep. Then I had an asthma attack which didn't respond well to my inhaler. I started having heart palpitations which continued all night. By morning when I finally got ahold of my sis and she had picked up my daughter I collapsed. Things were going dark. I was very cold. I was having a hard time remembering anything. It was hard to talk to the paramedics and I remember them saying I was semi conscious. They had to carry me out of the house and to the ER bed. It was really scary and I was in so much pain. I had written notes on my phone because I have medical trauma, PTSD and autism and was worried about a verbal shutdown which often happens. I kept trying to get people to read it and they would just hand it back and say that I should tell them in my own words right then the one single thing I was there for today. The nurse who was there when the paramedics did the hand-off was the one that I told part of my story to while she tried to start an IV. She was super sweet and reassured me that the help I had been waiting so many years for was finally here. I've been on a journey of remembering my own life. I've always had significant amnesia. Now I know why. It was so so terrible. I was in captivity for years by a man I thought I loved... because I couldn't remember the terrifying night he date r@ped me or when he moved in without my consent and then used drugs to convince me I was crazy and he was my loving partner who was caring for me.

I felt shock and horror. Some parts of me knew that my daughters father was my r@pist but another part found out today and they are not taking it well. The emotional flashback was triggered by my fear of something happening to me and my r@pist getting sole custody of my daughter. I have no idea what time is. I don't experience it's passage anymore. I'm just in pain every moment and my brain offers up the idea to just give up and die several times a day at least. I have severe amnesia right now so I've been writing things down and photographing them. Only by checking my photos did I find out that I'd been vomiting blood recently. I often don't remember anything I've done in the past 8 months or sometimes ever, but other moments I remember everything and then I usually find myself screaming uncontrollably. So back to today... the nurse who I told my story to disappeared and I never saw her again. Apparently she wasn't my nurse. My nurse didn't talk to me besides just telling me what she was doing. I was crying a lot of the time, shivering, cold, and in 10/10 pain. I laid there thinking over and over please God let this be it. I'm ready for it to be over. I just want to go. Or at least have a few hours of relief. The doctor comes in while I'm in a spasm. I can't speak hardly as it's hard to control my breathing. I'm too tired to breathe and want to stop. The doc gruffly asked why I was there. I tried to start to tell him and he cut me off. He said no no, what is the ONE reason you are here. I manage to reply pain. He says where. I say everywhere and start to elaborate to list it out and explain it all. He cuts me off and asks if my belly hurts. I say yes. He pushes everywhere and asks me to find the one spot that hurts the most out of the painful spots. I'm confused because we are completely off track and it's like he's blind and hasn't spoken to a single other person who had assessed me. Also I'm confused because pain and again having a super hard time holding it together and not full blown hyperventilating because it's so so bad. He orders an abdominal CT and a few labs. I get Zofran and Toradol which does absolutely nothing for my pain levels. At this point I've been crying for hours. For a while I even found myself on the floor of the bathroom with the light off crying my heart out very loudly. When someone found me they just said get up and get back in bed and they left. My crying was so intense it set off a series of crushing chest pains. So I try to stop crying. It's more of a whimper and quiet voice yell as I draw out each exhale and focus on my breath. This intensity of pain is like laboring was. The doctor comes in and says good news! All your results look great and you're being discharged...Follow up with this gastroenterologist for your GI problems. Completely ignoring the severe lethargy, extreme difficulty ambulating, kidney pain, altered mental status, chest pain, asthma attacks worsening and current meds not helping, inability to care for self, pain that makes my brain wish I was dead. Yay! Great news. Labs are good. I don't have a pcp or care team at all. I've been in survival mode every single day since maybe forever. I've literally begged for an admission to the hospital and I've been gaslit and ignored. When I dragged myself out of the hospital in my socks in the rain I wanted to just go lay down in the road. I wish I would have un@lived myself before I became a mother. No way in hell I'm leaving her without a fight, but goddammit why won't anyone help me? I don't need another phone number for a doctor with a 3 month wait list, or to be told to go to the DV agency when the local one didn't help me already. I need a safe bed and some actual sleep and actual quality medical care. I'm going to have a heart attack if I can't lower my pain to a level of stress I can tolerate or drink myself to death. Idk. I've been to dozens of doctors, lived in hospitals for probably 6 months if you add it up, trialed over 100 drugs, and costs well over 400k at this point. It's hard to feel like there is any hope left. I guess I'm posting this into the void so if I succumb someone can piece it together if anyone cares after I'm gone.",0,0,-1,-1

867,Anxiety,"Tbh it's always hard to pinpoint the cause of acid reflux and it's a big pain even with modern medicine. To stop things from coming up, try Gaviscon (it's over the counter) before going to bed. It creates a little layer at the top of your stomach that stops things from seeping up and it also acts as a general antacid. Energy drinks have high amounts of sugars and caffeine. Those both likely contribute to your reflux. Anxiety can cause GI symptoms and it may worsen symptoms of reflux. There could be so many other things that may be contributing to or causing this reflux. Nothing extreme, but for example, I have an under active thyroid that likely causes things to sit in my stomach for too long and could be contributing to the reflux. Maybe going for a blood test or speaking with a doctor to try and see if there's a cause or potential cause may help you determine the best ways to treat it. I struggle with reflux every day and I'm on the same page as you with the choking and coughing. My tips: Keep your head elevated at night (maybe try a wedge pillow), take Gaviscon as needed, try to stay as hydrated as possible, avoid foods with high sugar content, lots of caffeine, lots of oil/heavily fried Hoping you feel better soon :)",1,1,try Gaviscon (it's over the counter) before going to bed,-1

873,ADHD,"Thank you for the question. I wasn't diagnosed until my early 50's when ADHD went nuclear due to menopause (actually I was diagnosed once prior, but I forgot lol). Having rawdogged ADHD my entire life, I've dealt with eating disorders, RSD, ODD, rumination and anxiety. I worked in electronic dance music for half my life, so when the periods of overwhelm and emotional dysregulation hit, I'd self medicate on weekend rave benders. I used to call it a ""purge"". or ""clearing out the cobwebs"". I would reset and be back to normal. At that time, it was the only tool that worked. When I had kids, I could no longer do that. I would drink wine and try to tough it out which was not an effective strategy. I would be emotional, irritable and ruminate. Insomnia would hit. I thought I was losing my mind. I tried my best to act normal and internalise it. I'd eventually ride it out, but it could last a month or longer. Therapy helped a little, but it's difficult to stop a runaway train with words. Being diagnosed changed my life. Medication switched off the ADHD. Therapy finally worked because I had a framework for my behavior. I started to recognise my triggers. I simplified my life. I focused on my home being a safe space, I kept it neat and calm. I started exercising regularly and connecting with nature (grounding or earthing works wonders). I am able to manage minor symptoms like impatience, inattentiveness and impulsivity without medication. But I need medication when more serious symptoms hit, like periods of overwhelm, rumination and dysregulation. It provides immediate relief and kills the cycle. No more suffering. The biggest challenge is recognising the overwhelm phase when it starts. For some reason, I don't usually clock it until I'm in pretty deep, but the second I realise, I go back on medication and I'm instantly better. It really is a gift.

Alcohol is as addictive as most drugs and we don't discuss the crime element it creates. That's because since it's legal and can be bought in stores, it is relatively cheap. Almost everyone can come up with a few bucks to get alcohol for the day. It would be the same with drugs if they were legal. Generic oxycodone is dirt cheap for example. It would be even cheaper if it was sold over the counter. People are always going to use drugs anyway. That can't be stopped. Making them illegal creates an entire crime element that otherwise doesn't need to exist. No one would be creating fentanyl derivatives in a lab if people could buy oxycodone or pure/lab tested heroin in a store. There is also an abundance of evidence that the drug war and drug laws have nothing to do with public safety. The CIA sold and most likely continues to sell drugs, the government created crack cocaine and intentionally spread it in black neighborhoods, etc. It was never about public safety.

906,OpiatesRecovery,"The aspect of everything being free (including ambulance rides even for minor reasons, unlimited stays, emergency surgeries, prescribed meds) is the only good in this health care system. Otherwise, it's pretty fked. When we were visiting with the nursing school the hospital once a week for practice, we couldn't even find available beds or pillows for the new comer patients. Nurses graduating from major universities (4 years) vs the nurse assistant school (2 years), all nurses have the same duties! The only difference is in the salary only. In my visits there, I've seen a nurse, who is a graduate of the biggest, prestigious university doing her practice, she was taking care/cleaning/wiping whatever you call it, a bed ridden patient that defecated himself, while a nurse assistant at the same time was ... inserting an IV 3-way catheter on a hand of some new patient! Nurse assistants in other country no way they would be allowed to do that, heck even a simple IM injection! Here, you learn how to be a good nurse while practicing rather than what you learn in the nursing school, as the things are pretty different regarding the duties needed and applied in the bed, to the practice doll and the med equipment. In conclusion, this country is the paradise of the gabaergic and GABA-B agonists since all are OTC. Having access and self-medicating due to OTC meds, someone that is depressed and broke, might avoid e.g a doctor appointment in a private doctor to save like 50$ for the visit, and proceed to enter a pharmacy and buy an antidepressant that have read it worked great for others, while in fact it could be dangerous, as doctors are doctors, and can look at their online medical file to see for possible interactions if they are taking more than one med. So, the full access to all meds (except narcotics of course = 1. Benzos 2. Opis 3. Stimulants) could have catastrophic consequences if you buy a med that you have never took before, without the doctor's supervision. It's just convenient when e.g you need asap an anti emetic and if living in another country, you would need to find a doctor first to prescribe you Hydroxyzine or sth else (potent anti-emetic) because they would only offer OTC ginger natural anti-emetics while here you step into a pharmacy and ask directly for the med you want.

You say yes, I'm taking it for some time, my doctor has told me how to take it. That's it. You'll pay it and you have it.

There were technical problems with standardization of methods and agreement on the definition of the deficient state. In some tests a person was called deficient and when another laboratory did it they came up with different numbers and found not to be deficient. There was confusion. There was promotion of vitamin D testing by the vitamin D counsel who had hidden conflicts of interest as some members had invested in manufacturing and selling vitamin D. Because of the demand the test was improved but limitations still exist.

Populations at risk for deficiency may include those with obesity, osteoporosis, and long-term treatment with corticosteroids and anti-seizure medication.""

That in addition to regular OTC vitamin D in recommended regular concentrations can improve levels. One doesn't need a blood test for that.

That's what addiction basically is, it's self medicating. There's pros and cons to self medicating but anything excessive to the point where it's negatively affecting your health is not ok and will only hurt you, (your extreme milk consumption and lack of diet) You need to sit down, take a pen and paper and just assess your life right now. Writing notes helps amazingly for the adhd mind. I can't assess enough how much just writing things down on a white board started helping me actually move forward in my life.

925,AskDocs,"Then your attending was probably treating you as a case of Gastric ulcer. Did you have H.pylori testing done? Any history of NSAID use (painkillers like Ibuprofen)? H.pylori infection compounds ulcers and makes treatment hard, making it a recurring thing, so it's best if that was ruled out. As for NSAID use, that contribute to the development of NSAID induced ulcers and also exacerbate existing ones. Now to your meds, it must be know that sometimes, abruptly stopping PPIs like esomeprazole can cause a rebound acid hypersecretion. So you might want to err on the side of caution and taper it instead (decreasing the dose or decreasing the frequency until you eventually stop). And I do agree that long term use of PPIs arent good either unless truly necessary. The miralax for the constipation-you might want to take that on as needed basis instead. For example if your regular/normal habit is to poop every 2 days and it's been 3 or 4 days already, then take it. If all's up and running then skip. Adding a prokinetic drug might also help with the gassiness and constipation (with a doctor's real life consult and prescription ofc, self medicating with OTC drugs is never a good habit) What you can do outside of medications is improving your dietвЂ”High fiber (veggies), less greasy, and stay well hydrated. And increasing your activity (if that's not already being done)вЂ”helps with peristalsis.

927,Anxiety,"Therapy is the best way to move past the anxiety and get to the source of the problem. Exposure does work but u need to really push yourself to do what you're afraid of , not just go into a group of ppl, but maybe go further like publicly speak, go up to a stranger to talk, play music on the streets or whatever ur afraid to do.. Conquering fears are backed by science to reduce anxiety, so even if u think its NOT working, it likely is. Problem is , Majority of anxiety is psycho somatic Your perception of yourself can majorly help or hurt your progress. My 1st therapist used to have me differentiate rational fears and irrational fears. That can help to realize what ur feeling at times is just in your head. Meds help but are a bandaid and not a solution to it. If its sooo bad ur afraid to leave the house, its def worth considering something, at least an ssri. I recently discovered Thc vaping helps too. Not too much , like literally 1-2 puffs of hybrid pf specific strains , for me, Blue dream. I used to get MORE anxious from weed, but now it helps for sleep too. Biggest factor hands down is Sleep. Not getting enough is the difference between no panic attacks getting off bus miles before my stop due to one. Have hope. At my worst a decade ago, I thought I was dying I couldnt live like that anymore. It destroyed my life , lost my job dropped outta school due to panic attacks agoraphobia that was bad even with friends. Now, I cant remember the last time I had a panic attack, over a year/s. Idk what changed. I made the mistake of thinking nothing was working took up the offer of opiates when someone offered which is the equivalent of Zero anxiety to point of becoming out going. Like being at Peace for first time in my life . I LOVED it but then that destroyed my life worse than anxiety. Its why I push for ppl to get the meds they need befor they self medicate like I did. For whatever reason, it changed my brain chemistry and now I dont get panic attacks anymore, even after years clean. I still have anxiety but I can live with it now. I STILL see a therapist regularly cuz the trauma that caused the anxiety isnt healed. Years of being bullied plus broken home drama gave me anxiety. It DOESN'T make u less a man for having such. Anyone millenial or younger has dealt with A lot of stress, plus this is a strssful era in general. U gotta find the source with a therapist to figure out the cause so u can start to heal from it. And sometimes that takes going thru many therapists til u find the right one for u. Living with others shouldn't mean anxiety is worse for sure either. If u have trust among those ppl it should be much less. Home at least always felt like a haven to me, so thats sad that it isn't. Some OTHERa natural things that will reduce your anxiety guaranteed- Cardio- running, swimming laps , biking etc, build friendships, masturbation. The last one is essential to reducing stress too.

965,Anxiety,"True narcissists are incapable of being introverts. Ranking your personal feelings above that of others doesn't make you a narcissist, it actually makes you a normal person. In fact, narcissists use empathy as means of manipulation. If people think you're cold, it's because you don't feel comfortable with small talk as you place a great deal more value on the emotions you express than others do. You're more prone to ignore your own capacity for empathy due to your inability to outwardly express it, especially in social occassions when it's expected. There's nothing wrong with that. Feeling possessive of relationships be it friend or otherwise is natural for introverts. You do better one-on-one than in groups. When you lock in on someone it hurts you anytime they are around someone else. Even though you might have many friends, you prefer to just hang out with one or two at a time because being in larger social groups causes you to retreat into yourself. Again, there is nothing wrong with that. Many introverts turn to alcohol and drugs to self-medicate as it allows them to ignore their fears of social stigmas. The problem is that everyone you meet in these types of social engagements will never know who you are and this issue will compound until you're doing more and more partying just to hold on to the social circles you have. It's infinitely better to find social circles that allow you to be accepted for who you really are.

974,Drugs,"Ugh so much wrong with this Methamphetamine was indeed synthesized first in the late 1800s. Nagai Nagayoshi, the father of Japans pharmaceutical industry is credited as being the first person to isolate ephedrine and pseudoephedrine from the ephedra sinica bush. Much of his life's work revolved around finding a way to simplify the ephedrine molecule; as it was extremely valued at the time for being able to induce an adrenal surge however it's strain on the cardiovascular was cause of concern. Nagayoshi hoped to produce a drug that still replicated the adrenal surge but was less taxing on the heart. When he first synthesized meth it remained in its freebase form, and Nagayoshi dismissed it as useless; it didn't store well as it was so volatile it evaporated rapidly, and it was caustic and harmful to tissue if attempted to consume. For these reasons he never even tested the compound, and it's stimulant effects would go unnoticed for several decades. Amphetamine was first synthesized entirely independently. Nobody knew about methamphetamine, and it was a Romanian chemist operating in Germany who first discovered it. Again, this compound would largely be found unimpressive to the chemists and pharmacists in Germany and it was shelved as being more or less useless. Some American chemists took interest in the line of study that led the German chemists to amphetamine, and it was resynthesized in the USA and found to be impressive for it's peripheral nervous system properties, namely it's effects on the respiratory system. It was quickly adopted in the form of asthma inhalers; some parchment paper was dipped in the freebase oil and sealed in plastic capsules and it was sold under the brand name Benzedrine over the counter (similar to how its replacement propylhexedrine is sold in the Benzedrex inhalers to this day). It's properties as a central nervous system stimulant were beginning to be understood by researchers but what really accelerated this use of the drug was; methamphetamine hydrochloride. One of Nagai Nagayoshi's students was revisiting old shelved reductions of ephedrine and took interest in ""M-33"", as he believed he could render it usable/testable. First he coined a much cheaper and easier synthesis routes using hydroiodic acid as a reducing agent, produced by red phosphorus and iodine crystals. Next, he opted to gradually introduce hydrochloric acid to the freebase oil until it's pH was reduced to neutral and it was stabilized as a crystalline hydrochloride salt. The German pharmaceutical company ""Temmler"" took interest in meth hydrochloride as a stimulant drug, and marketed pressed pill rolls called 'Pervitin' to the public eventually gaining the attention of the Nazi controlled government who ordered it's mass production for Whermacht vehicle teams and officers. The relationship between ""*A*lpha-*M*ethyl*PHE*ne*T*hyl*AMINE*"" which was abbreviated; and methamphetamine in Germany became apparent and amphetamine was quickly manufactured in tablet and liquid forms for use as a stimulant too.

976,OpiatesRecovery,"Unfortunately for me, staying away from adderall indefinitely isn't really an option. Despite having an opiate addiction, I've never misused my adderall. I always take it as prescribed, and it doesn't really affect me the way it would someone without ADHD (although, i know I'm getting the dopamine rush all the same)I don't think I'm in a place where i can address my opiate addiction and the fall out from completely removing adderall from my life at the same time. I was blessed enough to have a solid 2 weeks to detox at home without work and responsibilities thanks to my support system, but real life started again today. I'm still at a point in my withdrawal where i have insomnia. I did go ahead and take one of my regular doses of adderall today. I will not be taking my late dose for a while so that I have adequate time to come down and hopefully be able to rest or sleep if I'm lucky. I'm completely aware that even though I don't abuse my adderall, there is undoubtedly a relationship between my use of opiates and my use of stimulants. I'm trying to address that by journaling my thoughts and feelings, triggers, etc. and with exercise, warm baths, and valerian root late in the evening. Before, I was ever addicted to opiates, when i was 17, i was started on stimulants because I just haven't been capable of functioning the way I'm supposed to. Keeping a clean, organized environment, keeping track of important dates, times, bills etc, and self care have all been major issues when I'm not medicated. However, I no longer want to be on adderall forever. My current plan is to address my opiate addiction and stabalize and then work on trying a non-stimulant option combined with intensive therapy. I really appreciate your response. Honestly, I'm not even sure why I asked. I've been down this road so many times. However, this is the first time where I'm truly trying to do the work and put thought into every choice I make, so I think that could be why.",1,1,I don't think I'm in a place where i can address my opiate addiction and the fall out from completely removing adderall,-1

Exceptions are meds that have a highly variable dose (e.g valproate is 100 tablets) or those intended for a short maximum course (e.g temazepam is 10 tablets) There is also the option for medications to go in a ""Webster pack"" or a ""dose roll"" - the medications are put in their daily (or BD or whatever) groups and they are given in a weekly ""set"" to the patient.

1008,OpiatesRecovery,"Well if you just relapsed for 3 months and used every single day, you're going to feel like shit. Having 6 months of clean time is good but if you've used for 10 ish years PAWs is pretty much guaranteed for a year. Also I stopped using cannabis, and while that's pretty trivial I think it's helped (and I am a horticulturalist who grows cannabis). I find it just makes me uncomfortable and lazy nowadays, and I can think a lot more clearly without it. I've had PAWs since July. I also stopped benzos then, and I was shooting meth, methylone, mephedrone, cocaine at the end of this relapse, and stopped in July. The polydrug / iv stim paws on top of stopping iv heroin use made me have SI everyday for months this winter. Once I got off methadone it got even worse. If I were to relapse on all those substances again there is no way in hell I'm doing that again, It was hell. On the bright side, I would like to think I'm seeing some improvement. It's really slow though. I was on methadone for most of 2024 and tapered off over 9 months. and have used suboxone prior. I'm pro MAT, but in all honesty, it just pushes the problem down the road and gives you a pharmaceutically pure, unadulterated opioid that you don't use iv or for a rush and that you can taper off of more smoothly once you have stabilised. With Methadone in particular, I felt my physical opioid dependence was just pushed down the line. Not to mention the havoc it does on your hormones. There's a lot of comobidity issues with seasonal depression, mental health, adhd, etc. I have treatment resistant depression, and no pharmaceuticals work to treat it. I use psychedelics occasionally and with intention, but even that's hit or miss. I finally have began treating my adhd and that seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle. I think I have literally been self medicating my entire adult life, to self treat both of those issues. Bottom line is there is not an easy or pain free solution to this shit, there's no free lunch out of withdrawal and out of PAWs. Even with the best nutritious diet I can muster, adequate exercise, proper supplementation, therapy, blah blah it was still just time that heals our neurotransmitters after heavy drug use.

1013,Drugs,"Well, this is complicated topic. But I try to simplify my answer. (This became a TED-talk ?? Take a cup of tea and enjoy my motivational rant??) YES! But it depends. On many factors tho. And should you even do it, even if you could self-medicate safely? Let's tackle this one by one. Firstly: What do we mean when we talk about a drug? I attach a great quote from Midnight Gospel show. It goes something like: ""Drugs are not good or bad. They just are. They are substances/chemicals created by nature or human. Problem is not the substance itself, but peoples relation to them."" That being said, are we talking about drug or medicine. What defines it? I have ADHD. If I go and buy Concerta/Adderall from the streets to self medicate, it is considered as a drug. But if doctor prescribes me the same pill, it is considered a medicine. Legally, that is. Even if the intent of use would be medicating. Same with weed. Cannabis needs a lot of more studies, but it is highly likely (and studied) that many people use cannabis to self-medication. Not even on purpose. Sometimes people use it recreationally, it feels good in moderation and even helps on problems, then they take it too much and symptoms worsen. Also creating addiction. Taking too much of anything, being it even ADHD meds messes you up. Risks and consequences. There are many levels on many drugs. But can you learn how to use it correctly? Sure, people do it all the time. Even most responsible adults have started their youth with playing with booze, vomiting and messing up. Learning from their mistakes, finding the balance and moderation. Same goes with many drugs. And also ""actual"" medicine or ""prescription drugs"" . (not gonna start a fight at this, drugs is so umbrella term for many things like for example psychedelics) You can also get addicted to medicine that is described for you, in a way. Like: Does the medicine do what it is supposed to do? Does it help with the problem like it should, improving your life? ADHD is like that. A medicine that could improve your life quality, since not treated or medicated could make you a total train wreck and ruin your life in many ways. Is it bad to be addicted to something that helps you live your life better? Is it bad to be dependent of the drug? Some people who get heart transplant, need to take medication so that their bodies don't reject the new heart?? Are they depended on it? Or addicted. Well yeah, kinda. But if they don't take it, they die. (and I know this is exaggerating, but you get the point) Now last thing: Is it good to be dependent on drug, even if it helps you? To be addicted to something that improves your life. Yes, and no. If the medicine helps you, it's good thing. That's what it's supposed to do. But is it the only option? Propably not. You could use the benefit of a drug to stabilize you and improve your life in a manner, so that you can do other improvements as well. ADHD meds are only half the solution. If you use meds but end them, many symptoms come back aprox in 6 months, give or take. Putting you back to base line, unless you used them to make changes that aid in future. 6-8 weeks of cognitive psychotherapy where you learn life skills and habits, scheduling, order, structure, managing symptoms etc helps even better, and can aid you up for rest of your life. Not to talk about meditation (stoic ????? for the win) excercise, healthy diet, vitamins, water and better life choices in general. And you you can combine the both, you are on a road to victory ?? Our environment affects our life in many ways. It's hard, I'm not saying that. But discomfort also creates strength?? And you should do the therapy if you think that would help. ""If someone you loved were in exactly the same position where you are now, what would you advice?"" If you would advice to get help, then you know the answer: Go get it. To healthcare and loved ones, friends you trust. There's no shame to ask help if needed. But be merciful of yourself aswell. Change takes time. Do some stoic meditations, take a 5min walk in fresh air, make a cup of tea/coffee, journal your racing thoughts in a journal (Brain dump, everything what stresses) and Take. Care. Of. Yourself. And relax. Give permission for that to yourself. Do something that makes you happy. That's a start! Love yourself first, so you can love others?? You feel so much better when you do it. And then, if you need to self medicate, do it. But ask yourself is it the only option you can do. What else could I do to feel better? Should I test what it likes to be sober, even just for a while. Few days, week? A month. You don't need to do it forever, just so you can do some inner growth and learn moderation, self-reflecting your past mistakes and what went right and worked, so you won't fail again so easily. People use drugs because... Drugs are fun?? But if they control your life, instead of you being in control, then you should do some self help and work with yourself. Sometimes it's fun to escape a reality a bit. But we still live in this reality, better make best of it and try to enjoy what life offers. Being grateful of small things and loved ones we have, instead what we don't have. There will always be things that stress you, things that don't go as planned, creating anxiety and depression. Meds can help to ease the edge when you are in a bad spot. But they are not ending solution. You learn ways to fight and tolerate them better and get back up. Even after you quit meds, you have learned ways to deal your problems better. Better than before atleast. That's growth. Day by day?? Funny thing about anxiety is, that it never actually ends. You just get used to it, and the topics of it change. New sources of anxiety come and go. But you grow better. That is actually good thing to know. ""We can't affect on our environment. Only how we react to it ourselves"" I know you can learn to react better?? Just find your own way to do it. Creating a better version of yourself: To yourself. Much love, stay safe???????",0,0,-1,-1
1014,ADHD,"Well, to start, there are lots of different medications for almost all conditions. There are a lot of different blood pressure meds, not just one kind. Googling comes up with 8 different categories of blood pressure medications, with multiple different drugs in each different category. Heck, even when you're talking about pain relievers, over the counter you can get aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen, or ibuprofen, and that's completely separate from prescription pain killers. In any case, ADHD meds work on your brain and its neurotransmitters, and brain chemistry is especially complicated and difficult to pin down.

You won't know what type of injury or how severe it is without getting checked out. You can go to an urgent care that has X-ray capabilities if you have insurance. But seriously, please go get looked at! Best case scenario, you gave yourself a decent sprain and can go home with an ACE wrap or something. Worst case scenario by not going can be an injury that doesn't heal properly and causes issues later on. In the meantime, good old RICE can help alleviate some of the pain. Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. OTC pain meds can help, too.

1022,Drugs,"What doses were you on, ROA? How much you using meth, how often, and ROA? Best I can advise,i having been using meth responsibly myself for 3-4 years now, is keep it strictly oral, dosing no more than twice a day, and keeping doses at around 5-15mg, depending on current tolerance. Your case might be different, depending on how much Adderall you were using, since at 200mg/day you're likely not to get much out of 20mg of meth. I recommend first and foremost (assuming it's possible), a couple of weeks off amphetamines to take a tolerance break. It won't reset your tolerance because, well, it's just not enough time considering how long you've been using, but it'll likely be enough for you to be able to lower your dose by quite a bit. Meth, orally, to me as someone who's diagnosed with adhd, feels a lot like dextroamp in some ways, in the sense that it's a very clear headed ""high"" (I don't really get any euphoria or really any recreational effects from it, so I can hardly call it a high, I'm self medicating because all I was able to get prescribed so far was Ritalin since psychs in my country are very anti amphetamine based medications - some going as far as to say they've run out of options once I hit Ritalin, this is after I try their shitty alternatives which are usually by this order, bupropion, Strattera, back to bupropion + vortioxetine when Strattera becomes unbearable and I tap out - did 4 months of that shit as a sign of good faith but I just couldn't anymore - then, and only then, do they add Ritalin on top of the bupropion (100 or 200mg, don't recall) + vortioxetine 10mg. I've gotten as high as 60mg of Ritalin a day and it never got less shitty. Doesn't help with motivation, gives me a ""dirty"" focus with what I can maybe describe as a brain fog which ironically makes it harder to work and be productive, even though I'm glued to the screen and not getting distracted with everyhting that's going on around me. Then I get nauseous asf and have a hard time eating, get splitting headaches if I don't eat or drink enough, I often forget to drink water, and by the end of the day I'm super cranky and too tired to properly think) Unlike phenidates, amphetamines actually do improve my focus and motivation, make my mind crystal clear and it's easy to think logically and solve problems, it actually gives me great pleasure in doing so. The only problems I get with amphetamines are loss of apetite and dry mouth, although that's easily solved by eating regularly, and I get tired/sleepy after lunch to the point where I'd fall asleep at my desk and basically nap for 30min-1h. That's after getting up and going for a walk and smoke break trying to wake myself up and fighting as hard as I could to stay awake. If possible, try not to take it every day (including week days, on the slower days don't take any, or don't go for the afternoon redose - this'll help you keep your tolerance steady and reduce the need to increase the dose. I've never needed more than 15mg when I was using it for work, and I've used it for up to 8-9 months in a row - being strict about my rules mentioned above that is - the only time I ever let tolerance rise was when I was mixing meth with coke to give me a bit of focus to go along with the coke's energy, I was unemployed and at home so I'd be redosing every 1-2h and often pull all nighters just playing cod or messing with electronics, so I was using a lot of meth a day and did it for a month straight, which then came along with a sweet comedown that made it super hard to do anything other than lay in bed depressed once I finished the coke, then started upping the dose of meth which naturally still wasn't giving me much other than a bit of focus, but still lethargic and depressed as hell.. And when the meth finished it was even worse. That was a hard couple of weeks, ngl)",1,1,"Meth, orally, to me as someone who's diagnosed with adhd, feels a lot like dextroamp… amphetamines actually do improve my focus and motivation, make my mind crystal clear and it's easy to think logically and solve problems.",-1

1031,OpiatesRecovery,"What's your current dosage daily? I jumped from g but wouldn't recommend it as that's rather high. Taper slowly, sub is unique in that it's a partial agonist so adding more like most doctors do does nothing. I dropped from 8mg to 2mg inside 4 weeks and felt nothing at all really except some minor sleep disturbances. Under 2mg is when your receptors start craving the drug. So a good taper plan is 25% of your dose every 2-4 weeks until you get super super low (like 0.2mg), then bite the bullet and jump. I think every drug addict or person who takes opiates regularly has a fear of withdrawal and the fear of sub withdrawal is worse than most as its quite drawn out. When I jumped, I felt fine on day 1 as the previous days dose was still in my system. Day 2-10 is where it hurt but even that was manageable. Willpower helps massively as does exercise. Literally forcing yourself to walk round the block or go for a swim when you feel like death. I promise you'll feel at least 70% better for a few hours. Likewise a good multivit is vital and probably some electrolytes - lucozade, gatorade to counter act the diarrhea that will inevitably come. OTC loperamide helps massively as well but DO NOT under any circumstances exceed the recommended dose. At higher doses loperamide crosses the blood-brain barrier and will absolutely remove all of your withdrawal symptoms, the trade off to that is your heart stopping as it messes with the electrical signals. It'll also completely reset the withdrawal as you've got another opiate blocking those receptors. I took 4mg in the morning and 2mg at night for 1 week then stopped.

1040,Drugs,"Where do you get off judging anyone for what they do or don't think? Who the fuck do you think you are? ADHD is a spectrum disorder. Different people have different levels of adhd. Most people who take stimulants find that they get jittery and grind their teeth. They don't feel restful and focused. If anything g they feel restless and full of anxiety. It causes your adrenal system to go into overdrive and for a lot of people that rush is a lot of fun. But that's not the effect someone with adhd considers fun. In fact, the way we feel like that is TO NOT TAKE OUR MEDICATION. When I'm off my meds, my life is a shambles. You would look at me and swear I was tweaked out my mind. I think about so many things that just walking into a new room causes me to lose track of what I'm doing. My house is full of half started projects that I will never finish because I can't focus. I literally don't get to see my bed for a long time because it's the only horizontal surface I had left to spread out with my latest project. This is what my life is like sober. In a miraculously short time after I'm back on my meds, it's like my body catches up with my thoughts and suddenly I can establish priorities and I can realize how fucking crazy my situation is. I start getting shit done and cleaning things up. I start remembering things and I actually have the wherewithal to socialize and maintain friendships without the omnipresent dread that everyone hates me if I don't hear from them every day. And I went for 35 years of doing drugs to feel normal before I finally talked to a psychiatrist. I had a lot of shame for doing drugs that other people got whacked out on but for me seemed base level. When I finally talked to a psychiatrist he diagnosed me right away and we tried numerous treatments until I found one that worked. I got off illicit drugs and now take prescriptions that provide the same peace of mind and focus that most people have every day. Self medicating is real even if you don't realize that's what's going on. And for someone to claim they have undiagnosed adhd to cover for their addiction, sometimes they are self medicating. I like drugs. Don't get me wrong. But the drugs I do for entertainment are things like acid or DMT or mushrooms. Amphetamines don't do it for me for having fun. All they do for me is make me sleepy.

1052,medicine,"Working in a country with universal healthcare (as an RN), I truly could not fathom for our patients, having the extra stressors of the financial burdens of healthcare. I recognize its exorbitant costs, and the time/effort of physicians and other specialists that comprise the system to treat, manage, and ""deal"" with difficult and frequently recurring patients. I absolutely would agree with others' statements that this ""right"" to healthcare could be bolstered by much stronger regulations in the public health sector in terms of creating more accessible healthy food options, stronger education about health maintenance and prevention, as well as, robust government intervention in medication costs In terms of compensation, ethics, and principles. Absolutely people should be compensated for their education, and we should have programming in place to aid in subsidizing these costs, as it is not only financial, but time. Losing out on 12 years of life to provide care for others deserves that appreciation and respect. As with other things? It has not been uncommon for me to witness ""hey doc, I have had this patient before, I truly do not believe I would be providing the best level of care I could given circumstances x,y,z. I would be more than happy to help you with a case or transfer a patient to me if that would be more agreeable with you."" Otherwise? Yes. Human beings were never 'asked' to be here, we simply just came to be, by the actions of others. Do I believe that people have to be accountable and responsible for their health? Absolutely. Returning back to the robust preventative care though, it is important, I believe, to recognize the role that our societies, our cultures, our values, and the ever shifting landscape of our day-to-day lives as an important aspect in our view of health. Why should my regular mid-life patient with EtOH abuse be turned away, when looking at the generational trauma, lack of community, familial dysfunction, and lack of supports that we can provide in our communities? Why should we, as human beings, look at a poor migrant family with poor health literacy, who did not understand how we could use OTC medications to manage a fever, does not understand how to access and utilize resources in a new society, and are fearful for their febrile, but otherwise, healthy child? Looking at healthcare through the lens of what it represents to me, is looking not at the ""costs of doing business,"" but at what ""costs"" we are able to protect by aiding people in returning to work, being able to assess and protect finite resources through honest discussions around health goals, and levels of care, and through prevention that we can produce with education. Is universal healthcare at times, sticky? Of course. Are there people who abuse the system? Yes. Is there at time, a lack of health literacy, or strong fears of mortality that cause frequent fliers to return requiring the same teaching and guidance many times? Yes. But, by-in-large?

As an aside, please don't take ibuprofen daily for more than about a week. It will cause more problems than it solves, and you don't need anymore challenges right now (The risk of stuff like ulcers goes way up with longer use).

1065,Drugs,"Yeah that urge feeling is what gets people coming back, depending on the drug it can be stronger or weaker For example my drug of choice is weed, when I started smoking I never had urges but now any time I take a break if I smoke it two days in a row my brain just had this ""I wanna"" urge, its not painful to fight off or anything but its there, meanwhile ive tried some more addictive drugs like hydromorphone which resulted in a week or two where id have random weird feelings where my brain would just keep saying ""silly dilly"" ""dillies hehe"" (Dilaudid being the brand name of hydromorphone i tried) it wasnt like I WANTED to but my body was having a reaction of ""haha hehe thats addictive"" Then you have ""mild"" addictiveness drugs like ketamine, i did it once a weekend as a self therapy thing for around a month and a half and I realized coming up on one of the weekends I realized i was looking forwards to it way more than I normally was and on top of it i felt an anxiety any time I questioned not doing it so I decided to drop it there, some drugs wont produce a craving until you get to a ""habitual"" state with them while others like opiods, Crack etc could produce this urge with a single use so you've gotta watch out with them The only way to not really spiral into addiction is by doing what you did, like honestly smoking Crack two days in a row ""wouldn't hurt"" anyone but the second you rationalize that second day the third and so on become impossible to deal with, prevent any ""cycle"" from arising that you may have to break later",1,1,"smoking Crack two days in a row ""wouldn't hurt"" anyone but the second you rationalize that second day the third and so on become impossible to deal with",-1

1071,OpiatesRecovery,"Yeah, sounds like you are taking more than what you may need. Suboxone is horrible at relieving back pain. I suffered for years with mid to lower back pain with sciatica. Believe it or not, opioids in general... provided very little back pain relief. It's typically a muscular skeletal problem. Over the counter pain relievers work much better. I use to take 550 mgs of naproxen (aleve) every 12 hours, with 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours. You can substitute the naproxen with ibuprofen... but I found naproxen to work better. I went years convinced that I needed opioids/NSAID'S to treat my back pain, disregarding multiple doctors who pushed for physical therapy. Finally, I gave it a try, and it was life changing. The physical therapy place I went to was not at all what I expected. I had 4 slipped disc's, impinged nerve roots and calcification of my sacrum. I went to PT two to three times a week, for one hour. The first 20 minutes or so did consist of stretching, but I was so tense, the ""stretching"" was just laying on my stomach with my arms crossed under my head for the first 2 visits. The next few visits, were propping myself up on my elbows, on my stomach... which arched my back. One minute on, one minute off. After a few weeks, I could push myself up on my hands, with my back arched, still on my stomach. I was given exercises to do at home at that point. Really simple ones, like ""cat and cow"", pelvic tilts, and reaching forward then backwards while standing. For the remaining 40 minutes of PT, my therapist would give me a 15 minute deep tissue massage, pressing down on pressure points/knots. Then she'd hook up the ""TENS"" unit, and cover the electrodes with a weighted down heating pad for the last 20 minutes or so. I'd leave feeling like jelly. After 6 weeks, she did start me on some more intense stretches, but I found them complicated and ineffective. So I stopped going. But... mainly because I was free of back pain for the first time in 5 years. It was pretty incredible. I still do stretches from time to time, when the pain creeps back in. But after a few days of stretching, the pain goes away. I recently bought a foam yoga roll/tube thing. I lay on that and roll around, getting it into those tight muscles that occur. I also lay on my back and place tennis balls under me, where there are any knots. I roll around, letting the balls dig into the knots until they ""release"". With severe back pain, we tend to hunch over, or curl up in a fetal position. But if you look at a model of the human spine, you can see how that contributes to the pain... essentially compressing the disc's more. So although counterintuitive, you want to lean in the opposite direction. The whole idea is to strengthen those muscles surrounding the spine, so that they can pull the vertebrae apart. I felt very foolish when I finally found this stuff out. As an addict, I was using my pain as an excuse to use. But after a while, the opioids were causing more pain than not. I believe it's called ""hyperalgesia"". Yet another concept I did not believe when doctors brought it up. I was in fairly significant denial, and just wanted my fucking pills!",1,1,Over the counter pain relievers work much better,opioids were causing more pain
1072,OpiatesRecovery,"Yeah, they tried to induce me after day two off a three gram a day habit. I was walking in circles saying ""fuck, fuck, fuck, what am I going to do, what am I going to do, fuck, fuck, fuck"". Laid on the floor of the shower for an hour, bed for an hour, shower for an hour and couldn't take anymore (maybe 12 hrs)and left. it took them two hours to get 1 mg of alazropam to me. It of course didn't do a lot. I think I might have slept 20 minutes. I was a soldier, I have never felt like that before and it was so bad. Damn, if you're inpatient you'd think they'd handle your symptoms. They have an MD vin staff, they had the meds in the building and they left me walking in circles for two hours. Not all treatments are like that and I understand that the one they sent me to has changed their medication routine (because of me) although I don't know what they did. Fent has ruined everything and now the xylizine? How freaking evil can you be to do that to get money? I saw a couple of misses turn black and eventually into scabs. Lumps if I skin popped. Any injection of ""tranq dope"" is a very bad idea unless you aren't expecting to ever come out and don't mind destroying yourself slowly. Google xylizine injury if you have a VERY strong stomach and don't believe me. If you can't get something without the tranq please, switch back to sniffing. I did as our area became inundated with it. It's still does the trick, actually, I think I like it better. Now, I do know it will lead to a plugged nose etc. but there are over the counter nose sprays you can get that fix it for you. I did that for the first 5 months of this go round and was fine.

1075,OpiatesRecovery,"Yeah. Zenes, fentalogues, there's even as bad or worse chemicals out there. For pain relief Cebranopadol has been in development with promising results for pain patients. SR-17018 and other SR compounds in the RC scene show promising results of people getting of fentanyl because of the unique properties of SR compounds and especially SR-17018, it's not even that potent (a little less potent than morphine) but due to how it works and it's unique set of effects and what it does with the brain and receptors it targets it's become a lifeline to people self-medicating their addiction. (I don't advocate for self-medicating, but I understand if people are able to get SR-17018 compounds and it helps them tremendously that they would do it on their own and follow the studies that come out on it as it would take years for a country to make it an actual medicine and it would take moving mountains for countries to develop more opioids aimed at helping addicts, atm they're mainly focussed on an opioid with no to little abuse potential and high pain relief and no signaling the beta-arrestin pathways which is how opioids affect breathing and slow it down) Reading about SR-17018 is for sure interesting though.

1076,OpiatesRecovery,"Yeah...When they banned it, it was done in complete ""silence"" vs the HHC ban that gave 1-2 weeks period to stock up. It was such a silent ban, that almost all the stores selling it continue to sell it for at least a month after the ban because not even the vendors were aware that Kratom was banned. Regarding cinnamon and omega 3 yes, in fact I read somewhere that you should always inform your dentist when going for a procedure that you are taking frequently either one or both. Because they thin the blood. I might be wrong or it might thin it to a lesser degree than what I think, but since that article stated that, then it makes sense as the extraction site needs to form a clot, which any blood thinners will delay it a lot, thus being in the ""danger zone"" of dry socket being extended. Indeed, after some times on opis they loose the ""opiated feeling"" which acts as antidepressant and giving motivation, and replaced by a meh state where motivation is low or non - existent. Taking more (let's say O-DSMT that I'm taking atm) will doesn't necessarily give more AD effects or motivation, but drive you immediately to the nodding nausea point. Since kratom is banned, O-DSMT is not sustainable for maintenance (it's pricey, has terrible compulsive redosing properties, its future is uncertain), Tramadol for maintenance is also not sustainable because it involves doctor shopping, so I'm left with either tapering and get back to my old depressed self (I forgot how living without opis being pumped in my blood is) so Bupe clinic is my only option, can't function without opis.

1080,OpiatesRecovery,"Yes to all of that - but the shitting blob on couch part - you can easily get rid of the shitting part by popping a few immodium - just a couple until you've subdued that portion of symptoms - to me that's basically the one single symptom you truly can eliminate from the hellish ride of WD, and I know that some people get concerned with taking more than a couple a day because it's got some mu-receptor thingies (or whatever the official term is but something related to mu opioids receptors or something close to that) that people just generally worry would count as an opiate in your body hence prolonging withdrawals but it's such a small amount compared to most addicts tolerance when they're detoxint that there's really no reason to worry about taking an initial dose of 2 and then adding one or two more every time you feel you still have those stomach cramps and the runs, until you're totally free of this symptom (should be no longer than a day of keeping up with the immodium dosing)вЂ¦.like once you've taken the maximum daily dosage you should really be fairly comfortable and free of being a shitting blob on the couch.

1092,Anxiety,"You are getting downvoted, but you are correct. The model that we have for addiction understands ""drug abuse"" as a relationship between a person and the medication. However, the ""rat park"" experiments demonstrate that propensity to compulsively take medications which numb feelings of trauma comes from a lack of social and community supports for the things which are negatively impacting their psychological health. In other words, in order to treat ""addiction"", you must treat the individual's trauma. In order to treat trauma, you must remove traumatizing conditions. Removing the medications in order to try and do this only causes trauma. This is why the predominant method for treating addiction, abstinence, is doomed to fail, and that is conveyed in its success rates (or lack thereof) in treating addiction. However, we still try and make addiction out to be an illness, rather than a symptom of trauma. The treatments that we use, like 12 step programs and being hypervigilent about ""enabling"" people, ignores that in every single case of addiction there is trauma that people are self medicating. And if you treat the trauma, the self medication will subside. There's nothing inherently different about an ""addict""'s brain that makes them self medicate. There's no ""once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic"" that is supported by science. There are people with trauma, who self medicate, who are taught to resist the urge to self medicate while not addressing the reason why they have the urge to self medicate, with varying degrees of success for varying periods of time, who are made to feel wrong and evil because of this normal biological response to experiencing trauma.",1,1,"And if you treat the trauma, the self medication will subside.",-1

Yes it is a weaker compound compared to Oxy or Fentanyl but some people are just more sensitive to painkillers. Me for instance, I was a hardcore heroin addict for over 10 years, in my area the H was over 90% pure. And the Suboxone doctor recommended 16mg sub per day(forever right lol)... I stabilized on 8mg for one week, and ended up only on 2mg for the rest of the time I was on it. Everyone is different is what you come to realize. I would say be careful with the Suboxone... it is a far more addictive and dopamine saturating chemical than DHC. They say its only a ""partial"" agonist, but this only downplays how addictive it can be. You thought right: A week is probably the right time frame to taper off. Any more and you risk becoming addicted to the Suboxone which will me miles worse than being addicted to DHC and much much harder to get off of. Truly, you might be better off finding an alternative way to detox. Comfort meds, perhaps even small Kratom usage, over the counter meds. If all else fails, the Suboxone route is always there. Oh!

It might not be bona fide, but it's a relationship. It largely depends on what the medical advice is and the outcome of it. Let's say someone stubbed their toe and asked if they should go to the ER, and you tell them, nah, just watch it, apply ice, take over the counter pain meds, and see how it goes. Then a week later, it's not better and they go to an urgent care and an Xray showed a fractured toe. Can they sue you for that? Sure. Would they win? When pigs fly.

If you give a medical advice and no one else was around to hear it, did you really give an advice?

I'm not trying to belittle what you're going through, but as others have said as well, this is just the beginning. All the shit you mentioned is terrible, but it gets so much worse if you don't stop. Hardship isn't a risk its a guarantee when you get in deep with addiction. I've lost more jobs than I can count. Lost the woman I loved (more than once). Spent tens if not hundreds of thousand of dollars with nothing to show for it. Put myself in risky situations and around sketchy people that have nearly cost me my life. Have broken bones, had surgeries, and cope with chronic issues that are a direct results of prolonged drug use. Probably the worst is I've lost all trust from the people I love and care about and completely destroyed my reputation and credibility. Its not like I'm a whole helluv a lot older than you either. I'm 28. All the stuff happening to you right now sucks. I know it sucks and probably feels like the end of the world, but resiliency is an astonishing thing. Use that as a wake up call to do things differently. As much as I'm sure you hate to hear it, you're young. You will bounce back no problem from this if you make some changes. Instant gratification makes it so hard to put effort into things we don't see immediate results from because drugs condition us in that manner. Just know that the best things in life are the things that take time and effort. Sacrifice is part of maturing and building a meaningful life. The older you get and the more you avoid your problems the worse it will get. I've tried ignoring problems in childish hopes that they'd go away. They never do. They only get way worse. Owing dealers is a BAD road to go down. If you take only one thing away from this, take that. I don't know for sure, but I'm assuming these aren't hardcore lifetime dealers, but still, take this as a lesson. Cause if you mess with the wrong dealer it can get ugly. Like lights out GameOver real quick. Here's the hardest part if you're anything like me (or most addicts), you're feeling like shit, down on yourself, and thinking how could things be any worse than they are. The first thing you're gona want to do is escape that feeling and say fuck it and go get high. This will help for a couple hours until you come down and are hit with the same exact dilemma only worse cause now you've dug just a little deeper. But addiction is a sinister thing and it will keep you saying fuck it to escape the fucked up situation you're in (which was caused by using in the first place). Its a messed up cycle of getting high to escape problems, which causes more problems, which makes you want to get high even more. Get some professional help if you need some. See a doctor and get your health checked out. Look into a therapist and maybe even a psychiatrist that can get you on meds if you need them. Many people self medicate to fix problems and don't even realize they're doing so. Talk to your parents if you are having trouble stopping. I know that can be scary, but I'm sure they would rather help and support you than watch you unravel. Give your girl some space. Write her a letter, like old school pen and paper style and write it from the heart. Own up to your mistakes and show accountability for your actions. Everyone makes mistakes and does things they're not proud of. Its how you handle yourself and confront those challenges that will define who you are. Don't overthink or think too far ahead just approach it all one day at a time and ask yourself each day what can I do to be a little bit better than I was yesterday.

I didn't go into the evaluation with a intended solution like I do with my medical doctor, I went to find out if my suspicions were correct and if the behaviors I had always done to mask it were legit. The reason for the evaluation was that I had gotten COVID and it messed up my thinking and my physical ""stats"" so to speak( in game terms, like perception, endurance, focus) and literally before Covid, I suspected but I was doin all these tasks and systems to be a succesful adult and so I didnt NEED anything else, but all that came crashing down after Covid exposed me. I went into the evaluation honestly, just to find out. The results were sent to my PCP and the Psych doctors recommendation, despite all I told them about how I usually cope, was to start me on stimulant medication. I didn't ASK for it. I didnt even Mention it. It was their recommendation after evaluation. So, ""They"" DO prescribe medication for adult ADHD. Their justification was that whatever I had been doing to cope wasn't working anymore and my lifestyle , job and health were at risk if I were unable to regain the minimum amount of function I had previously. Don't feel bad to express how much you are suffering. It is embarrasing, you will want to play it down to not look ""pathetic"" but the lowest of your lows is what they need to KNOW about you in order to gauge what might be the problem, what might help and what won't. If you had a burn out, Tell them everything you do to try to seem ""normal"". What systems do you use? Do you use multiple alarms, Do you have a timer in every room of your house? Do you write notes to your self and stick them all over the house? Must you label a drawer on the outside to remember what is inside? Do you have a mental tantrum if something you usually use in one place is moved to another? Can you start a task and get distracted to a totally different task that has a commonprecursor to the first ? (e.g. I need to clear the counter, so I move dishes to the sink and start water, but then instead of going back to the counter to move more things, I start washing dishes instead. The counter is still cluttered and I cannot use it for the project I intended to do) or ( e.g. My boss asks me to review the results of the tests for 400 participants, and as I look I realize a pattern, so I spend the rest of the day writing a formula to highlight that pattern and show the result which , btw, accomplishes the same outcome, but was not what I was tasked to do) Do you have trouble with the transition required to take a shower/bath? Do you stay up all night because something caught your attention? Do you struggle with yourself to not act impulsively? Are you a unredeemable people pleaser? Do you struggle to read large blocks of texts but can listen to audio books? or do voices sound like noise but you can read forever? everyone is different, but that doesn't change how difficult is is to process what is difficult for YOU. These kind of things reck havoc on your self care, your mental focus, and your ability to follow through on tasks. The Psych doc needs to know this stuff. Sorry I blabbered. I just remembered how exposed I felt with these strangers who told me to just relax and be myself and breaking through my boundaries of comfort, I did and I was so embarrassed but they saw ME.

This comment is for general information purposes only, and not intended to provide medical advice. No physician-patient relationship is implied or established._ ___A 60 year old female came into the emergency.department after an overdose of psychiatric medication. She was profoundly confused and had significant signs and symptoms of a dangerous overdose. Activated charcoal was ordered to absorb some of the medicine to help prevent further injury or death. Because of the severity of signs and symptoms, she required admission to the intensive care unit for close medical monitoring.___ ___When asked about what happened, she stated that she had inadvertently taken a second dose of her medication on an empty stomach, but the severity of the overdose was such that there was a concern that she was minimizing, and had actually tried to self-harm, and she stayed that she would rather be dead than feel this way, so she was placed on one-to-one observation.___ ___Once she was out of medical danger and more alert, hospital staff tried to talk to her about this possible overdose, but she was hostile and dismissive, which delayed their ability to determine whether this was a suicide attempt or simple mistake___ ___Rather than helping clear this up, she left the hospital against medical advice.___ ___On a second visit, there was another apparent overdose. Because of the first visit, the hospital staff was concerned again about possible self harm. Again, rather than being cooperative, the patient was aggressive with the medical residents who were interviewing her, refused recommended testing, was not forthcoming during a psychiatric interview, and seemed to be paranoid about the appearance of some of the staff. After being observed for 48 hours, it was determined that the risk of self harm was low, and the patient was discharged.___ I hope you can see that there are different ways to view the same event. Patients who present with serious medication overdoses are always screened for self harm. Patients who have done this inadvertently are generally cooperative, and work with the staff. Patients who are uncommunicative, deceitful, uncooperative and / or hostile generally will require closer scrutiny, as our goal is to prevent further self harm in these cases. Me: 60f, 5'6/164, IBD and atypical depression with a very mild cycling mood disorder--not even unipolar so when asked I simple say atypical. Non smoker, social drinker (1-2 per week). Meds: Lialda, Spirinolactone, Lamictal, Pristiq, Abilify. Xanax to sleep Over the past ten years I have needed an ambulance to take me to the ER. The first time, I accidentally took my meds twice on an empty stomach, collapsed in my home, and called 911. By the time I was in the ER I was vomiting and disassociating. The ER doc asked me what I was taking, said ""So you're bipolar"" and I said no, completely missed that I was in some sort of oculargyric storm, and made me drink charcoal. I begged for something for the nausea and said ""Make me less nauseaus or kill me."" They put me in the ICU because they believed I was a suicidal bioplar who had OD'd. I begged them to call my psychiatrist or take a lamictal blood level and they refused. My urine tox screen showed PCP (I know it was from the Pristiq but they didn't) and benzos (which I had told them I took). At four am, the ER resident, the hospital psych, and three nurses came to ""discuss my drug use."" At this point I was back to the cranky middle aged woman I am, and said a few curse words. By the time I reached a friend to come get me, I'd been there a day and a half. I called my psychiatrist, and he said ""Put on your pants and leave, they think you've tried to kill yourself. Alas, I had no pants and it was February. A few hours later my brother brought pants and while they tried to convince me otherwise, we left. The second time, my GP had given me too much blood pressure medicine. I fell in my kitchen and couldn't get up. (Like the commercial.) At the hospital, I knew I had to be calm and collected after what had happened before. Yet things played out similarly despite being a tad more in control and I could be firmer with the residents treating me. This time there were two psychiatrists wanting to talk about my mood disorder. Still, I didn't want to give them urine, and they sent one mean woman after another with a cup to my hospital room. The last one looked like she rode a Harley, complete with motorcycle books and a Hells Angel t-shirt. I spent two days here, too. So here is my predicament: How do I handle this, knowing it's now happened two times, in NYC so not some podunk place. How do I, as a middle aged woman with depression who is not a suicide risk, navigate the hospital if I ever have to go again. I feel like they see middle aged lady + mood stabilizers and they immediately think I'm a nut case. I'm afraid to get angry when treated this way for fear they will lock me in the psych ward. I don't have a husband/spouse/child to advocate for me. Why does this happen in the first place--don't women like me have actual accidents?

SSRIs were originally synthesized from antihistamines, and they can make SSRIs less effective for a few days, but they have almost no SERT activity themselves. How likely/common is serotonin syndrome? Extremely rare. Your psych is unlikely to ever actually encounter it. Even an OD on an entire bottle of meds is unlikely to cause it. Even taking multiple serotonergics isn't a problem. SSRIs reduce serotonin synthesis globally (where most of the side effects come from, also why SS is so insanely rare with SSRIs) so it's only really a problem with something that increases serotonin synthesis bypassing the tryptophan step. 5-HTP is the big one OTC that can be a problem, as synthesis to serotonin from 5-HTP is poorly modulated, but otherwise intermediates that can become serotonin are pretty rare. Most of the drug-drug interactions with SSRIs are things that use the same CYP enzymes for metabolism and taking them together results in higher serum levels of the drug. Side effects scale with dose so they can cause new or worse side effects, also higher dose doesn't mean more effective so the drug can become less effective.",1,1,"5-HTP is the big one OTC that can be a problem, as synthesis to serotonin from 5-HTP is poorly modulated.",-1
