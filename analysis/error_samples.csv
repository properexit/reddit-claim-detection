"Even in U.S where you need a script even for... Hydroxyzine ? Where I live (in EU), in my country all meds (except narcotics and antibiotics) are OTC. If we want to get a med cheap AF, we go to a public doctor (public servant) you pay nothing for the visit, they e-prescribe and later at the pharmacy, you give them the printed prescription and pay only 25% if insured, and completely nothing if uninsured. Otherwise, we go to a pharmacy, ask for the med and mgs we want, pay it 100% its price and voila, mission complete. Most citizens here going in the prescription route, are usually the elderly or when it's a prescription for benzos, opis or stims (or antibiotics) or when we want very expensive meds. The state pays them for us. Including the Bupe substitution clinic. The clinic is free as well (and state-operated) and unlimited subs supply, free for life. Methadone is banned though for some years now, but slowly in some clinics they are starting again to use it.",0,1,"Even in U.S where you need a script even for...

"I don't remember the exact cocktail but I remember it was a bunch of Prozac, quanfacine, amitriptyline, and some OTC things.

"Wow this sounds like a female version of me. Early 20s I started with OTC then Rx codeine for back pain, have had a script ever since but it's never been enough, and OTC codeine has been gone since 2018 here. I'm guessing you're in the UK because of DHC and online scripts, I've been there and when codeine linctus was OTC and before online pharmacies cracked down I'd buy heaps of them. Then I started getting DHC (DF118) from somewhere that had 100x bottles OTC until Glaxo stopped manufacturing them. I've bought thousands of extra pills over my script, added in tramadol and also have a script for Lyrica (I don't like it, fucking horrible medication). They're trying to take my opioids away and it terrifies me, I'm not ready to face the pain (MRI has confirmed it's real, I'm not just taking them for the sake of it, but I definitely have a problem) or the withdrawal. Part of me wishes I'd never taken them, the other part loves them.",0,1,"Wow this sounds like a female version of me.",0.637,narrative_framing,"This is an extended personal narrative expressing affect and experience rather than making a discrete factual or evaluative claim."
"My apologies, I failed to describe the medication change scenario. I started taking Allegra a year ago every today for around three months, there was no decrease in lymph node size and my doctor said it was okay to quit taking it. When I mentioned lymph nodes again the only answer I got was ""some people's are just like that."" But it's so bothersome that I can't really believe this is a normal occurrence with no underlying cause.

"Most of the mid levels working urgent cares—and probably a few doctors as well—don't even interpret rapid strep tests correctly. A large number of people are chronically colonized with strep. You can swab a completely asymptomatic person and it will come back positive. You can swab someone with sore throat who is having clearly viral symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough, congestion), and they're positive.
